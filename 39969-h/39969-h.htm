<p class="p2">A course in biology given to beginners in the secondary
school should have certain aims. These aims must be determined to a degree,
first, by the capabilities of the pupils, second, by their native
interests, and, third, by the environment of the pupils.</p>

<p>The boy or girl of average ability upon admission to the secondary
school is not a thinking individual. The training given up to this time,
with but rare exceptions, has been in the forming of simple concepts. These
concepts have been reached didactically and empirically. Drill and memory
work have been the pedagogic vehicles. Even the elementary science work
given has resulted at the best in an interpretation of some of the common
factors in the pupil's environment, and a widening of the meaning of some
of his concepts. Therefore, the first science of the secondary school,
elementary biology, should be primarily the vehicle by which the child is
taught to solve problems and to think straight in so doing. No other
subject is more capable of logical development. No subject is more vital
because of its relation to the vital things in the life of the child. A
series of experiments and demonstrations, discussed and applied as definite
concrete problems which have arisen within the child's horizon, will
develop power in thinking more surely than any other subject in the first
year of the secondary school.</p>

<p>But in our eagerness to develop the power of logical thinking we must
not lose sight of the previous training of our pupil. Up to this time the
method of induction, that handmaiden of logical thought, has been almost
unknown. Concepts have been formed deductively by a series of comparisons.
All concepts have been handed down by the authority of the teacher or the
text; the inductive search for the unknown is as yet a closed book. It is
unwise, then, to directly introduce the pupil to the method of induction
with a series of printed directions which, though definite in the mind of
the teacher because of his wider horizon, mean <a name="Page_8"
id="Page_8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>little or nothing as a
definite problem to the pupil. The child must be brought to the
appreciation of the problem through the deductive method, by a comparison
of the future problem with some definite concrete experience within his own
field of vision. Then by the inductive experiment, still led by a series of
oral questions, he comes to the real end of the experiment, the conclusion,
with the true spirit of the investigator. The result is tested in the light
of past experiment and a generalization is formed which means something to
the pupil.</p>

<p>For the above reason the laboratory problems, which naturally precede
the textbook work, should be separated from the subject matter of the text.
A textbook in biology should serve to verify the student's observations
made in the laboratory, it should round out his concept or generalization
by adding such material as he cannot readily observe and it should give the
student directly such information as he cannot be expected to gain directly
or indirectly through his laboratory experience. For these reasons the
laboratory manual has been separated from the text.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The laboratory method was such an emancipation from
the old-time bookish slavery of pre-laboratory days that we may have been
inclined to overdo it and to subject ourselves to a new slavery. It should
never be forgotten that the laboratory is simply a means to the end; that
the dominant thing should be a consistent chain of ideas which the
laboratory may serve to elucidate. When, however, the laboratory assumes
the first place and other phases of the course are made explanatory to it,
we have taken, in my mind, an attitude fundamentally wrong. The question
is, not what <i>types</i> may be taken up in the laboratory to be fitted
into the general scheme afterwards, but what <i>ideas</i> are most worth
while to be worked out and developed in the laboratory, if that happens to
be the best way of doing it, or if not, some other way to be adopted with
perfect freedom. Too often our course of study of an animal or plant takes
the easiest rather than the most illuminating path. What is easier, for
instance, particularly with large classes of restless pupils who apparently
need to be kept in a condition of uniform occupation, than to kill a supply
of animals, preferably as near alike as possible, and set the pupils to
work drawing the dead remains? This method is usually supplemented by a
series of questions concerning the remains which are sure to keep the
pupils busy a while longer, perhaps until the bell strikes, and which
usually are so planned as to anticipate any ideas that might naturally crop
up in the pupil's mind during the drawing exercise.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>"Such an abuse of the laboratory idea is all
wrong and should be avoided. The ideal laboratory ought to be a retreat for
rainy days; a substitute for out of doors; a clearing house of ideas
brought in from the outside. Any course in biology which can be confined
within four walls, even if these walls be of a modern, well-equipped
laboratory, is in some measure a failure. Living things, to be appreciated
and correctly interpreted, must be seen and studied in the open where they
will be encountered throughout life. <i>The place where an animal or plant
is found is just as important a characteristic as its shape or
function.</i> Impossible field excursions with large classes within school
hours, which only bring confusion to <i>inflexible</i> school programs, are
not necessary to accomplish this result. Properly administered, it is
without doubt one of our most efficient devices for developing biological
ideas, but the laboratory should be kept in its proper relation to the
other means at our disposal and never be allowed to degenerate either into
a place for vacuous drawing exercises or a biological morgue where dead
remains are viewed."&mdash;<i>Dr. H. E. Walter.</i></p>

<p>For the sake of the pupil the number of technical and scientific terms
has been reduced to a minimum. The language has been made as simple as
possible and the problems made to hinge upon material already known, by
hearsay at least, to the pupil. So far as consistent with a well-rounded
course in the essentials of biological science, the interests of the
children have been kept in the foreground. In a recent questionnaire sent
out by the author and answered by over three thousand children studying
biology in the secondary schools of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
and New York by far the greatest number gave as the most interesting topics
those relating to the care and functions of the human body and the control
and betterment of the environment. As would be expected, boys have
different biological interests from girls, and children in rural schools
wish to study different topics from those in congested districts in large
communities. The time has come when we must frankly recognize these
interests and adapt the content of our courses in biology to interpret the
<i>immediate</i> world of the pupil.</p>

<p>With this end in view the following pages have been written. This book
shows boys and girls living in an urban community how they may best live
within their own environment and how they may coöperate with the civic
authorities for the betterment of their environment. A logical course is
built up around the <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>topics which appeal to the average normal boy
or girl, topics given in a logical sequence so as to work out the solution
of problems bearing on the ultimate problem of the entire course, that of
preparation for citizenship in the largest sense.</p>

<p>Seasonal use of materials has been kept in mind in outlining this
course. Field trips, when properly organized and later used as a basis for
discussion in the classroom, make a firm foundation on which to build the
superstructure of a course in biology. The normal environment, its relation
to the artificial environment of the city, the relations of mutual give and
take existing between plants and animals, are better shown by means of
field trips than in any other way. Field and museum trips are enjoyed by
the pupils as well. These result in interest and in better work. The course
is worked up around certain great biological principles; hence insects may
be studied when abundant in the fall in connection with their relations to
green plants and especially in their relation to flowers. In the winter
months material available for the laboratory is used. Saprophytic and
parasitic organisms, wild plants in the household, are studied in their
relations to mankind, both as destroyers of food, property and life and as
man's invaluable friends. The economic phase of biology may well be taken
up during the winter months, thus gaining variety in subject matter and in
method of treatment. The apparent emphasis placed upon economic material in
the following pages is not real. It has been found that material so given
makes for variety, as it may be assigned as a topical reading lesson or
simply used as reference when needed. Cyclic work in the study of life
phenomena and of the needs of organisms for oxygen, food, and reproduction
culminates, as it rightly should, in the study of life-processes of man and
man's relation to his environment.</p>

<p>In a course in biology the difficulty comes not so much in knowing what
to teach as in knowing what <i>not</i> to teach. The author believes that
he has made a selection of the topics most vital in a well-rounded course
in elementary biology directed toward civic betterment. The physiological
functions of plants and animals, the hygiene of the individual within the
community, conservation and the betterment of existing plant and animal
products, the <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
11]</span>big underlying biological concepts on which society is built,
have all been used to the end that the pupil will become a better, stronger
and more unselfish citizen. The "spiral" or cyclic method of treatment has
been used throughout, the purpose being to ultimately build up a number of
well-rounded concepts by constant repetition but with constantly varied
viewpoint.</p>

<p>The sincere thanks of the author is extended to all who have helped make
this book possible, and especially to the members of the Department of
Biology in the De Witt Clinton High School. Most of the men there have
directly or indirectly contributed their time and ideas to help make this
book worth more to teachers and pupils. The following have read the
manuscript in its entirety and have offered much valuable constructive
criticism: Dr. Herbert E. Walter, Professor of Zoölogy in Brown University;
Miss Elsie Kupfer, Head of the Department of Biology in Wadleigh High
School; George C. Wood, of the Department of Biology in the Boys' High
School, Brooklyn; Edgar A. Bedford, Head of Department of Biology in the
Stuyvesant High School; George E. Hewitt, George T. Hastings, John D.
McCarthy, and Frank M. Wheat, all of the Department of Biology in the De
Witt Clinton High School.</p>

<p>Thanks are due, also, to Professor E. B. Wilson, Professor G. N.
Calkins, Mr. William C. Barbour, Dr. John A. Sampson, W. C. Stevens, and C.
W. Beebe, Dr. Alvin Davison, and Dr. Frank Overton; to the United States
Department of Agriculture; the New York Aquarium; the Charity Organization
Society; and the American Museum of Natural History, for permission to copy
and use certain photographs and cuts which have been found useful in
teaching. Dr. Charles H. Morse and Dr. Lucius J. Mason, of the De Witt
Clinton High School, prepared the hygiene outline in the appendix. Frank M.
Wheat and my former pupil, John W. Teitz, now a teacher in the school, made
many of the line drawings and took several of the photographs of
experiments prepared for this book. To them especially I wish to express my
thanks.</p>

<p>At the end of each of the following chapters is a list of books which
have proved their use either as reference reading for students or as aids
to the teacher. Most of the books mentioned are within <a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>the means of the small
school. Two sets are expensive: one, <i>The Natural History of Plants</i>,
by Kerner, translated by Oliver, published by Henry Holt and Company, in
two volumes, at $11; the other, <i>Plant Geography upon a Physiological
Basis</i>, by Schimper, published by the Clarendon Press, $12; but both
works are invaluable for reference.</p>

<p>For a general introduction to physiological biology, Parker,
<i>Elementary Biology</i>, The Macmillan Company; Sedgwick and Wilson,
<i>General Biology</i>, Henry Holt and Company; Verworn, <i>General
Physiology</i>, The Macmillan Company; and Needham, <i>General Biology</i>,
Comstock Publishing Company, are most useful and inspiring books.</p>

<p>Two books stand out from the pedagogical standpoint as by far the most
helpful of their kind on the market. No teacher of botany or zoölogy can
afford to be without them. They are: Lloyd and Bigelow, <i>The Teaching of
Biology</i>, Longmans, Green, and Company, and C. F. Hodge, <i>Nature Study
and Life</i>, Ginn and Company. Other books of value from the teacher's
standpoint are: Ganong, <i>The Teaching Botanist</i>, The Macmillan
Company; L. H. Bailey, <i>The Nature Study Idea</i>, Doubleday, Page, and
Company; and McMurry's <i>How to Study</i>, Houghton Mifflin Company.

<h2>A CIVIC BIOLOGY</h2>

<h3 class="p4">I. THE GENERAL PROBLEM&mdash;SOME REASONS FOR THE STUDY OF
BIOLOGY</h3>

<p class="p2"><b>What is Biology?</b>&mdash;<i>Biology is the study of
living beings, both plant and animal.</i> Inasmuch as man is an animal, the
study of biology includes the study of man in his relations to the plants
and the animals which surround him. Most important of all is that branch of
biology which treats of the mechanism we call the human body,&mdash;of its
parts and their uses, and its repair. This subject we call <i>human
physiology</i>.</p>

<p><b>Why study Biology?</b>&mdash;Although biology is a very modern
science, it has found its way into most high schools; and an increasingly
large number of girls and boys are yearly engaged in its study. These
questions might well be asked by any of the students: Why do I take up the
study of biology? Of what practical value is it to me? Besides the
discipline it gives me, is there anything that I can take away which will
help me in my future life?</p>

<p><b>Human Physiology.</b>&mdash;The answer to this question is plain. If
the study of biology will give us a better understanding of our own bodies
and their care, then it certainly is of use to us. That phase of biology
known as <i>physiology</i> deals with the uses of the parts of a plant or
animal; human physiology and hygiene deal with the uses and care of the
parts of the human animal. The prevention of sickness is due in a large
part to the study of hygiene. It is estimated that over twenty-five per
cent of the deaths that occur yearly in this country could be averted if
<i>all</i> people lived in a hygienic manner. In its application to the
lives of each of us, as a member of our family, as a member of the school
we attend, and as a future citizen, a knowledge of hygiene is of the
greatest importance.</p>

<p><b>Relations of Plants to Animals.</b>&mdash;But there are other reasons
why an educated person should know something about biology. <a
name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>We do
not always realize that if it were not for the green plants, there would be
no animals on the earth. Green plants furnish food to animals. Even the
meat-eating animals feed upon those that feed upon plants. How the plants
manufacture this food and the relation they bear to animals will be
discussed in later chapters. Plants furnish man with the greater part of
his food in the form of grains and cereals, fruits and nuts, edible roots
and leaves; they provide his domesticated animals with food; they give him
timber for his houses and wood and coal for his fires; they provide him
with pulp wood, from which he makes his paper, and oak galls, from which he
may make ink. Much of man's clothing and the thread with which it is sewed
together come from fiber-producing plants. Most medicines, beverages,
flavoring extracts, and spices are plant products, while plants are made
use of in hundreds of ways in the useful arts and trades, producing
varnishes, dyestuffs, rubber, and other products.</p>

<p><b>Bacteria in their Relation to Man.</b>&mdash;In still another way,
certain plants vitally affect mankind. Tiny plants, called <i>bacteria</i>,
so small that millions can exist in a single drop of fluid, exist almost
everywhere about us,&mdash;in water, soil, food, and the air. They play a
tremendous part in shaping the destiny of man on the earth. They help him
in that they act as scavengers, causing things to decay; thus they remove
the dead bodies of plants and animals from the surface of the earth, and
turn this material back to the ground; they assist the tanner; they help
make cheese and butter; they improve the soil for crop growing; so the
farmer cannot do without them. But they likewise sometimes spoil our meat
and fish, and our vegetables and fruits; they sour our milk, and may make
our canned goods spoil. Worst of all, they cause diseases, among others
tuberculosis, a disease so harmful as to be called the "white plague."
Fully one half of all yearly deaths are caused by these plants. So
important are the bacteria that a subdivision of biology, called
<i>bacteriology</i>, has been named after them, and hundreds of scientists
are devoting their lives to the study of bacteria and their control. The
greatest of all bacteriologists, Louis Pasteur, once said, "It is within
the power of man to cause all parasitic diseases (diseases mostly caused by
bacteria) to disappear <a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>from the world." His prophecy is gradually
being fulfilled, and it may be the lot of some boys or girls who read this
book to do their share in helping to bring this condition of affairs
about.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Animals to Man.</b>&mdash;Animals also play an
important part in the world in causing and carrying disease. Animals that
cause disease are usually tiny, and live in other animals as
<i>parasites</i>; that is, they get their living from their hosts on which
they feed. Among the diseases caused by parasitic animals are malaria,
yellow fever, the sleeping sickness, and the hookworm disease. Animals also
<i>carry</i> disease, especially the flies and mosquitoes; rats and other
animals are also well known as spreaders of disease.</p>

<p>From a money standpoint, animals called insects do much harm. It is
estimated that in this country alone they are annually responsible for
$800,000,000 worth of damage by eating crops, forest trees, stored food,
and other material wealth.</p>

<p><b>The Uses of Animals to Man.</b>&mdash;We all know the uses man has
made of the domesticated animals for food and as beasts of burden. But many
other uses are found for animal products, and materials made from animals.
Wool, furs, leather, hides, feathers, and silk are examples. The arts make
use of ivory, tortoise shell, corals, and mother-of-pearl; from animals
come perfumes and oils, glue, lard, and butter; animals produce honey, wax,
milk, eggs, and various other commodities.</p>

<p><b>The Conservation of our Natural Resources.</b>&mdash;Still another
reason why we should study biology is that we may work understandingly for
the conservation of our natural resources, especially of our forests. The
forest, aside from its beauty and its health-giving properties, holds water
in the earth. It keeps the water from drying out of the earth on hot days
and from running off on rainy days. Thus a more even supply of water is
given to our rivers, and thus freshets are prevented. Countries that have
been deforested, such as China, Italy, and parts of France, are now subject
to floods, and are in many places barren. On the forests depend our supply
of timber, our future water power, and the future commercial importance of
cities which, like New York, are located at the mouths of our navigable
rivers.</p>

<p><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
18]</span><b>Plants and Animals mutually Helpful.</b>&mdash;Most plants and
animals stand in an attitude of mutual helpfulness to one another, plants
providing food and shelter for animals; animals giving off waste materials
useful to plants in the making of food. We also learn that plants and
animals need the same conditions in their surroundings in order to live:
water, air, food, a favorable temperature, and usually light. The life
processes of both plants and animals are essentially the same, and the
living matter of a tree is as much alive as is the living matter in a fish,
a dog, or a man.</p>

<p><b>Biology in its Relation to Society.</b>&mdash;Again, the study of
biology should be part of the education of every boy and girl, because
society itself is founded upon the principles which biology teaches. Plants
and animals are living things, taking what they can from their
surroundings; they enter into competition with one another, and those which
are the best fitted for life outstrip the others. Animals and plants tend
to vary each from its nearest relative in all details of structure. The
strong may thus hand down to their offspring the characteristics which make
them the winners. Health and strength of body and mind are factors which
tell in winning.</p>

<p>Man has made use of this message of nature, and has developed improved
breeds of horses, cattle, and other domestic animals. Plant breeders have
likewise selected the plants or seeds that have varied toward better
plants, and thus have stocked the earth with hardier and more fruitful
domesticated plants. Man's dominion over the living things of the earth is
tremendous. This is due to his understanding the principles which underlie
the science of biology.</p>

<p>Finally the study of biology ought to make us better men and women by
teaching us that unselfishness exists in the natural world as well as among
the highest members of society. Animals, lowly and complex, sacrifice their
comfort and their very lives for their young. In the insect communities the
welfare of the individual is given up for the best interests of the
community. The law of mutual give and take, of sacrifice for the common
good, is seen everywhere. This should teach us, as we come to take our
places in society, to be willing to give up our individual pleasure or
selfish gain for the good of the community in which we live. Thus the
application of biological principles will benefit society.</p>

up my own environment and how I can aid in their control.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Environment.</b>&mdash;Each one of us, no matter where he
lives, comes in contact with certain surroundings. Air is everywhere around
us; light is necessary to us, so much so that we use artificial light at
night. The city street, with its dirty and hard paving stones, has come to
take the place of the soil of the village or farm. Water and food are a
necessary part of our surroundings. Our clothing, useful to maintain a
certain temperature, must also be included. All these things&mdash;air,
light, heat, water, food&mdash;together make up our <i>environment</i>.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">An unfavorable city environment.</p>
</div>

<p>All other animals, and all plants as well, are surrounded by and use
practically the same things from their environment as we do. The potted
plant in the window, the goldfish in the aquarium, your pet dog at home,
all use, as we will later prove, the factors of their environment <a
name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>in the
same manner. Air, water, light, a certain amount of heat, soil to live in
or on, and food form parts of the surroundings of <i>every</i> living
thing.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i024b.jpg"
 width="250" height="739"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">An experiment that shows the air contains about four
 fifths nitrogen.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Same Elements found in Plants and Animals as in their
Environment.</b>&mdash;It has been found by chemists that the plants and
animals as well as their environment may be reduced to about eighty very
simple substances known as <i>chemical elements</i>. For example, the air
is made up largely of two elements, <i>oxygen</i> and <i>nitrogen</i>.
Water, by means of an electric current, may be broken up into two elements,
<i>oxygen</i> and <i>hydrogen</i>. The elements in water are combined to
make a <i>chemical compound</i>. The oxygen and nitrogen of the air are not
so united, but exist as separate gases. If we were to study the chemistry
of the bodies of plants and animals and of their foods, we would find them
to be made up of certain chemical elements combined in various complex
compounds. These elements are principally <i>carbon</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>,
<i>oxygen</i>, <i>nitrogen</i>, and perhaps a dozen others in very minute
proportions. But the same elements present in the living things might also
be found <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
21]</span>in the environment, for example, water, food, the air, and the
soil. It is logical to believe that living things use the chemical elements
in their surroundings and in some wonderful manner build up their own
bodies from the materials found in their environment. How this is done we
will learn in later chapters.</p>

<p><b>What Plants and Animals take from their Environment.</b>
<b>Air.</b>&mdash;It is a self-evident fact that animals need air. Even
those living in the water use the air dissolved in the water. A fish placed
in an air-tight jar will soon die. It will be proven later that plants also
need air in order to live.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Chart to show the percentage of chemical elements in
 the human body.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Water.</b>&mdash;We all know that water must form part of the
environment of plants and animals. It is a matter of common knowledge that
pets need water to drink; so do other animals. Every one knows we must
water a potted plant if we expect it to grow. Water is of so much
importance to man that from the time of the Caesars until now he has spent
enormous sums of money to bring pure water to his cities. The United States
government is spending millions of dollars at the present time to bring by
irrigation the water needed to support life in the western desert
lands.</p>

<p><b>Light as Condition of the Environment.</b>&mdash;Light is another
important factor of the environment. A study of the leaves on any green
plant growing near a window will convince one that such plants grow toward
the light. All green plants are thus influenced by the sun. Other plants
which are not green seem either indifferent or are negatively influenced
(move away from) the source of light. Animals may or may not be attracted
by light. A moth, for example, will fly toward a flame, an earthworm will
move away from light. Some animals prefer a moderate or <a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>weak intensity of
light and live in shady forests or jungles, prowling about at night. Others
seem to need much and strong light. And man himself enjoys only moderate
intensity of light and heat. Look at the shady side of a city street on any
hot day to prove this statement.</p>

 <p class="caption">The effect of light upon a growing plant.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Heat.</b>&mdash;Animals and plants are both affected by heat or the
absence of it. In cold weather green plants either die or their life
activities are temporarily suspended,&mdash;the plant becomes
<i>dormant</i>. Likewise small animals, such as insects, may be killed by
cold or they may <i>hibernate</i> under stones or boards. Their life
activities are stilled until the coming of warm weather. Bears <a
name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>and
other large animals go to sleep during the winter and awake thin and active
at the approach of warm weather. Animals or plants used to certain
temperatures are killed if removed from those temperatures. Even man, the
most adaptable of all animals, cannot stand great changes without
discomfort and sometimes death. He heats his houses in winter and cools
them in summer so as to have the amount of heat most acceptable to him,
<i>i.e.</i> about 70° Fahrenheit.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Vegetation in Northern Russia. The trees in this
 picture are nearly one hundred years old. They live under conditions of
 extreme cold most of the year.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Environment determines the Kind of Animals and Plants within
It.</b>&mdash;In our study of geography we learned that certain luxuriant
growths of trees and climbing plants were characteristic of the tropics
with its moist, warm climate. No one would expect to find living there the
hardy stunted plants of the arctic region. Nor would we expect to find the
same kinds of animal life in warm regions as in cold. The surroundings
determine the kind of living things there. Plants or animals <i>fitted to
live</i> in a given locality will probably be found there if they have had
an opportunity to <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>reach that locality. If, for example,
temperate forms of life were introduced by man into the tropics, they would
either die or they would gradually change so as to become fitted to live in
their new environment. Sheep with long wool fitted to live in England, when
removed to Cuba, where conditions of greater heat exist, soon died because
they were not fitted or <i>adapted</i> to live in their changed
environment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 width="500" height="355"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Plant life in a moist tropical forest. Notice the air
 plants to the left and the resurrection ferns on the tree trunk.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Adaptations.</b>&mdash;Plants and animals are not only fitted to live
under certain conditions, but each part of the body may be fitted to do
certain work. I notice that as I write these words the fingers of my right
hand grasp the pen firmly and the hand and arm execute some very
complicated movements. This they are able to do because of the free
movement given through the arrangement of the delicate bones of the wrist
and fingers, their attachment to the bones of the arm, a wonderful complex
of muscles which move the bones, and a directing nervous system which plans
the work. Because of the peculiar fitness in the structure of the <a
name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>hand
for this work we say it is adapted to its function of grasping objects.
Each part of a plant or animal is usually fitted for some particular work.
The root of a green plant, for example, is fitted to take in water by
having tiny absorbing organs growing from it, the stems have pipes or tubes
to convey liquids up and down and are strong enough to support the leafy
part of the plant. Each part of a plant does work, and is fitted, by means
of certain structures, to do that work. It is because of these adaptations
that living things are able to do their work within their particular
environment.</p>

<p><b>Plants and Animals and their Natural Environment.</b>&mdash;Those of
us who have tried to keep potted plants in the schoolroom know how
difficult it is to keep them healthy. Dust, foreign gases in the air, lack
of moisture, and other causes make the artificial environment in which they
are placed unsuitable for them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px">
 <img src="images/i029.jpg"
 width="300" height="366"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">A natural barrier on a stream. No trout would be found
 above this fall. Why not?</p>
</div>

<p>A goldfish placed in a small glass jar with no food or no green water
plants soon seeks the surface of the water, and if the water is not changed
frequently so as to supply air the fish will die. Again the artificial
environment lacks something that the fish needs. Each plant and animal is
limited to a certain environment because of certain individual needs which
make the surroundings fit for it to live in.</p>

<p><b>Changes in Environment.</b>&mdash;Most plants and animals do not
change their environment. Trees, green plants of all kinds, and some
animals remain <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
26]</span>fixed in one spot practically all their lives. Certain tiny
plants and most animals move from place to place, either in air, water, on
the earth or in the earth, but they maintain relatively the same conditions
in environment. Birds are perhaps the most striking exception, for some may
fly thousands of miles from their summer homes to winter in the south.
Other animals, too, migrate from place to place, but not usually where
there are great changes in the surroundings. A high mountain chain with
intense cold at the upper altitudes would be a barrier over which, for
example, a bear, a deer, or a snail could not travel. Fish like trout will
migrate up a stream until they come to a fall too high for them to jump.
There they must stop because their environment limits them.</p>

<p><b>Man in his Environment.</b>&mdash;Man, while he is like other animals
in requiring heat, light, water, and food, differs from them in that he has
come to live in a more or less artificial environment. Men who lived on the
earth thousands of year ago did not wear clothes or have elaborate homes of
wood or brick or stone. They did not use fire, nor did they eat cooked
foods. In short, by slow degrees, civilized man has come to live in a
changed environment from that of other animals. The living together of men
in communities has caused certain needs to develop. Many things can be
supplied in common, as water, milk, foods. Wastes of all kinds have to be
disposed of in a town or city. Houses have come <a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>to be placed close
together, or piled on top of each other, as in the modern apartment. Fields
and trees, all outdoor life, has practically disappeared. Man has come to
live in an artificial environment.</p>

<p><b>Care and Improvement of One's Environment.</b>&mdash;Man can modify
or change his surroundings by making this artificial environment favorable
to live in. He may heat his dwellings in winter and cool them in summer so
as to maintain a moderate and nearly constant temperature. He may see that
his dwellings have windows so as to let light and air pass in and out. He
may have light at night and shade by day from intense light. He may have a
system of pure water supply and may see that drains or sewers carry away
his wastes. He may see to it that people ill with "catching" or
<i>infectious</i> diseases are isolated or <i>quarantined</i> from others.
This care of the artificial environment is known as <i>sanitation</i>,
while the care of the <i>individual</i> for himself within the environment
is known as <i>hygiene</i>. It will be the chief end of this book to show
girls and boys how they may become good citizens through the proper control
of personal hygiene and sanitation.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Object of a Field Trip.</b>&mdash;Many of us live in
the city, where the crowded streets, the closely packed apartments, and the
city playgrounds form our environment. It is very artificial at best. To
understand better the <i>normal environment</i> of plants or animals we
should go into the country. Failing in this, an overgrown city lot or a
park will give us much more closely the environment as it touches some
animals lower than man. We must then remember that in learning something of
the natural environment of other living creatures we may better understand
our own environment and our relation to it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
On any bright warm day in the fall we will find insects swarming everywhere
in any vacant lot or the less cultivated parts of a city park.
Grasshoppers, butterflies alighting now and then on the flowers, brightly
marked hornets, bees busily working over the purple asters or golden rod,
and many other forms hidden away on the leaves or stems of plants may be
seen. If we were to select for observation some partially decayed tree, we
would find it also inhabited. Beetles would be found boring through its
bark and wood, while caterpillars (the young stages of butterflies or
moths) are feeding on its leaves or building homes in its branches.
Everywhere above, on, and under ground may be noticed small forms of life,
many of them insects. Let us first see how we would go to work to identify
some of the common forms we would be likely to find on plants. Then a
little later we will find out what they are doing on these plants.</p>

 <p class="captionj">An insect viewed from the side. Notice the head,
 thorax, and abdomen. What other characters do you find?</p>
</div>

<p><b>How to tell an Insect.</b>&mdash;A bee is a good example of the group
of animals we call <i>insects</i>. If we examine its body carefully, we
notice that it has three regions, a front part or <i>head</i>, a middle
part called the <i>thorax</i>, and a hind portion, jointed and hairy, the
<i>abdomen</i>. We cannot escape noting the fact that this insect has wings
with which it flies and that it also has legs. The three pairs of legs,
which are jointed and provided with tiny hooks at the end, are attached to
the thorax. Two pairs of delicate wings are attached to the upper or
<i>dorsal</i> side of the thorax. The thorax and indeed the entire body, is
covered with a hard shell of material similar to a cow's horn, there being
no skeleton inside for the attachment of muscles. If we carefully watch the
abdomen of a living bee, we notice it move up and down quite regularly. The
animal is breathing through tiny breathing holes called <i>spiracles</i>,
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
30]</span>placed along the side of the thorax and abdomen. Bees also have
compound eyes. Wings are not found on all insects, but all the other
characters just given are marks of the great group of animals we call
<i>insects</i>.</p>

 <p class="caption">Part of the compound eye of an insect (highly
 magnified).</p>
</div>

<p><b>Forms to be looked for on a Field Trip.</b>&mdash;Inasmuch as there
are over 360,000 different species or kinds of insects, it is evident that
it would be a hopeless task for us even to think of recognizing all of
them. But we can learn to recognize a few examples of the common forms that
might be met on a field trip. In the fields, on grass, or on flowering
plants we may count on finding members from six groups or <i>orders</i> of
insects. These may be known by the following characters.</p>

<p>The order <i>Hymenoptera</i> (membrane wing) to which the bees, wasps,
and ants belong is the only insect group the members of which are provided
with true stings. This sting is placed in a sheath at the extreme hind end
of the abdomen. Other characteristics, which show them to be insects, have
been given above.</p>

<p>Butterflies or moths will be found hovering over flowers. They belong to
the order <i>Lepidoptera</i> (scale wings). This name is given to them
because their wings are covered with tiny scales, which fit into little
sockets on the wing much as shingles are placed on a roof. The dust which
comes off on the fingers when one catches a butterfly is composed of these
scales. The wings are always large and usually brightly colored, the legs
small, and one pair is often inconspicuous. These insects may be seen to
take liquid food through a long tubelike organ, called the
<i>proboscis</i>, which they keep rolled up under the head when not in use.
The young of the butterfly or moth are known as <i>caterpillars</i> and
feed on plants by means of a pair of hard jaws.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers, found almost everywhere, and crickets, black
grasshopper-like insects often found under stones, belong to the order
<i>Orthoptera</i> (straight wings). Members of this group may usually be
distinguished by their strong, jumping hind legs, by their chewing or
biting mouth parts, and by the fact that the hind wings are folded up under
the somewhat stiffer front wings. <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 <i>Hymenoptera</i>, about natural size. <i>C</i>, a bug, one of the
 <i>Hemiptera</i>, about natural size. <i>D</i>, a butterfly, an example of
 the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, slightly reduced. <i>E</i>, a house fly, an
 example of the <i>Diptera</i>, about twice natural size. <i>F</i>, an
 orb-weaving spider, about half natural size. (This is not an insect, note
 the number of legs.) <i>G</i>, a beetle, slightly reduced, one of the
 <i>Coleoptera</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Another group of insects sometimes found on flowers in the fall are
flies. They belong to the order <i>Diptera</i> (two wings). These insects
are usually rather small and have a single pair of gauzy <a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>wings. Flies are of
much importance to man because certain of their number are disease
carriers.</p>

<p>Bugs, members of the order <i>Hemiptera</i> (half wings), have a jointed
proboscis which points backward between the front legs. They are usually
small and may or may not have wings.</p>

<p>The beetles or <i>Coleoptera</i> (sheath wings), often mistaken for bugs
by the uneducated, have the first pair of hardened wings meeting in a
straight line in the middle of the back, the second pair of wings being
covered by them. Beetles are frequently found on goldenrod blossoms in the
fall.</p>

<p>Other forms of life, especially <i>spiders</i>, which have four pairs of
walking legs, <i>centipedes</i> and <i>millepedes</i>, both of which are
wormlike and have many pairs of legs, may be found.</p>

<p>Try to discover members of the six different orders named above. Collect
specimens and bring them to the laboratory for identification.</p>

<p><b>Why do Insects live on Plants?</b>&mdash;We have found insect life
abundant on living green plants, some visiting flowers, others hidden away
on the stalks or leaves of the plants. Let us next try to find out
<i>why</i> insects live among and upon flowering green plants.</p>

<p><b>The Life History of the Milkweed Butterfly.</b>&mdash;If it is
possible to find on our trip some growing milkweed, we are quite likely to
find hovering near, a golden brown and black butterfly, the monarch or
milkweed butterfly (<i>Anosia plexippus</i>). Its body, as in all insects,
is composed of three regions. The monarch frequents the milkweed in order
to lay eggs there. This she may be found doing at almost any time from June
until September.</p>

<p><b>Egg and Larva.</b>&mdash;The eggs, tiny hat-shaped dots a twentieth
of an inch in length, are fastened singly to the underside of milkweed
leaves. Some wonderful instinct leads the animal to deposit the eggs on the
milkweed, for the young feed upon no other plant. The eggs hatch out in
four or five days into rapid-growing wormlike caterpillars, each of which
will shed its skin several times before it becomes full size. These
caterpillars possess, in addition to the three pairs of true legs,
additional pairs of <i>prolegs</i> or caterpillar legs. The animal at this
stage is known as a <i>larva</i>.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Monarch butterfly: adults, larvæ, and pupa on their
 food plant, the milkweed. (From a photograph loaned by the American Museum
 of Natural History.)</p>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
33]</span><b>Formation of Pupa.</b>&mdash;After a life of a few weeks at
most, the caterpillar stops eating and begins to spin a tiny mat of silk
upon a leaf or stem. It attaches itself to this web by the last pair of
prolegs, and there hangs in the dormant stage known as the <i>chrysalis</i>
or <i>pupa</i>. This is a resting stage during which the body changes from
a caterpillar to a butterfly.</p>

<p><b>The Adult.</b>&mdash;After a week or more of inactivity in the pupa
state, the outer skin is split along the back, and the adult butterfly
emerges. At first the wings are soft and much smaller than in the adult.
Within fifteen minutes to half an hour after the butterfly emerges,
however, the wings are full-sized, having been pumped full of blood and
air, and the little insect is ready after her wedding flight to follow her
instinct to deposit her eggs on a milkweed plant.</p>

<p><b>Plants furnish Insects with Food.</b>&mdash;Food is the most
important factor of any animal's environment. The insects which we have
seen on our field trip feed on the green plants among which they live. Each
insect has its own particular favorite food plant or plants, and in many
cases the eggs of the insect are laid on the food plant so that the young
may have food close at hand. Some insects prefer the rotted wood of trees.
An American zoölogist, Packard, has estimated that over 450 kinds of
insects live upon <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>oak trees alone. Everywhere animals are
engaged in taking their nourishment from plants, and millions of dollars of
damage is done every year to gardens, fruits, and cereal crops by
insects.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">
 <img src="images/i038.jpg"
 width="300" height="234"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Damage done by insects. These trees have been killed by
 boring insects.</p>
</div>

<p><b>All Animals depend on Green Plants.</b>&mdash;But insects in their
turn are the food of birds; cats and dogs may kill birds; lions or tigers
live on still larger defenseless animals as deer or cattle. And finally
comes man, who eats the bodies of both plants and animals. But if we reduce
this search after food to its final limit, we see that green plants provide
<i>all</i> the food for animals. For the lion or tiger eats the deer which
feeds upon grass or green shoots of young trees, or the cat eats the bird
that lives on weed seeds. Green plants supply the food of the world. Later
by experiment we will prove this.</p>

<p><b>Homes and Shelter.</b>&mdash;After a field trip no one can escape the
knowledge that plants often give animals a home. The grass shelters
millions of grasshoppers and countless hordes of other small insects which
can be obtained by sweeping through the grass with an insect net. Some
insects build their homes in the trees or bushes on which they feed, while
others tunnel through the wood, making homes there. Spiders build webs on
plants, often using the leaves for shelter. Birds nest in trees, and many
other wild animals use the forest as their home. Man has come to use all
kinds of plant products to aid him in making his home, wood and various
fibers being the most important of these.</p>

<p><b>What do Animals do for Plants?</b>&mdash;So far it has seemed that
green plants benefit animals and receive nothing in return. We will later
see that plants and animals <i>together</i> form a balance of life on the
earth and that one is necessary for the other. Certain <a name="Page_35"
id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>substances found in
the body wastes from animals are necessary to the life of a green
plant.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj"> A section of a flower, cut lengthwise. In the center
 find the pistil with the ovary containing a number of ovules. Around this
 organ notice a circle of stalked structures, the stamens; the knobs at the
 end contain pollen. The outer circles of parts are called the petals and
 sepals, as we go from the inside outward.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Insects and Flowers.</b>&mdash;Certain other problems can be worked
out in the fall of the year. One of these is the biological interrelations
between insects and flowers. It is easy on a field trip to find insects
lighting upon flowers. They evidently have a reason for doing this. To find
out why they go there and what they do when there, it will be first
necessary for us to study flowers with the idea of finding out what the
insects get from them, and what the flowers get from the insects.</p>

<p><b>The Use and Structure of a Flower.</b>&mdash;It is a matter of common
knowledge that flowers form fruits and that fruits contain seeds. They are,
then, very important parts of certain plants. Our field trip shows us that
flowers are of various shapes, colors, and sizes. It will now be our
problem first to learn to know the parts of a flower, and then find out how
they are fitted to attract and receive insect visitors.</p>

<p><b>The Floral Envelope.</b>&mdash;In a flower the expanded portion of
the flower stalk, which holds the parts of the flower, is called the
<i>receptacle</i>. <i>The green leaflike parts covering the unopened flower
are called the sepals.</i> Together they form the <i>calyx</i>.</p>

<p><i>The more brightly colored structures are the petals.</i> Together
they form the <i>corolla</i>. The corolla is of importance, as we shall see
later, in making the flower conspicuous. Frequently the petals or corolla
have bright marks or dots which lead down to the base of the cup of the
flower, where a sweet fluid called <i>nectar</i> is made and <a
name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
36]</span>secreted. It is principally this food substance, later made into
honey by bees, that makes flowers attractive to insects.</p>

<p><b>The Essential Organs.</b>&mdash;A flower, however, could live without
sepals or petals and still do the work for which it exists. Certain
<i>essential organs</i> of the flower are within the so-called floral
envelope. They consist of the <i>stamens</i> and <i>pistil</i>, the latter
being in the center of the flower. The structures with the knobbed ends are
called <i>stamens</i>. In a single stamen the boxlike part at the end is
the <i>anther</i>; the stalk which holds the anther is called the
<i>filament</i>. The anther is in reality a hollow box which produces a
large number of little grains called <i>pollen</i>. Each pistil is composed
of a rather stout base called the <i>ovary</i>, and a more or less
lengthened portion rising from the ovary called the <i>style</i>. The upper
end of the style, which in some cases is somewhat broadened, is called the
<i>stigma</i>. The free end of the stigma usually secretes a sweet fluid in
which grains of pollen from flowers of the same kind can grow.</p>

<p><b>Insects as Pollinating Agents.</b>&mdash;Insects often visit flowers
to obtain pollen as well as nectar. In so doing they may transfer some of
the pollen from one flower to another of the same kind. This transfer of
pollen, called <i>pollination</i>, is of the greatest use to the plant, as
we will later prove. No one who sees a hive of bees with their wonderful
communal life can fail to see that these insects play a great part in the
life of the flowers near the hive. A famous observer named Sir John Lubbock
tested bees and wasps to see how many trips they made daily from their
homes to the flowers, and found that the wasp went out on 116 visits during
a working day of 16 hours, while the bee made but a few less visits, and
worked only a little less time than the wasp worked. It is evident that in
the course of so many trips to the fields a bee must light on hundreds of
flowers.</p>

 <p class="caption">Bumblebees. <i>a</i>, queen; <i>b</i>, worker;
 <i>c</i>, drone.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Adaptations in a Bee.</b>&mdash;If we look closely at the bee, we
find the body and legs more or less covered with tiny hairs; especially are
these hairs found on the legs. <i>When a plant or animal structure is
fitted to do a certain kind of work, we say it is adapted to do that
work.</i> The joints in the leg of the bee adapt it for complicated
movements; the arrangement of stiff hairs along the edge of a concavity in
one of the joints of the leg forms a structure well <a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>adapted to hold
pollen. In this way pollen is collected by the bee and taken to the hive to
be used as food. But while gathering pollen for itself, the dust is caught
on the hairs and other projections on the body or legs and is thus carried
from flower to flower. The value of this to a flower we will see later.</p>

<p><b>Field Work.</b>&mdash;<b>Is Color or Odor in a Flower an Attraction
to an Insect?</b>&mdash;Sir John Lubbock tried an experiment which it would
pay a number of careful pupils to repeat. He placed a few drops of honey on
glass slips and placed them over papers of various colors. In this way he
found that the honeybee, for example, could evidently distinguish different
colors. Bees seemed to prefer blue to any other color. Flowers of a yellow
or flesh color were preferred by flies. It would be of considerable
interest for some student to work out this problem with our native bees and
with other insects by using paper flowers and honey or sirup. Test the
keenness of sight in insects by placing a white object (a white golf ball
will do) in the grass and see how many insects will alight on it. Try to
work out some method by which you can decide whether a given insect is
attracted to a flower by odor alone.</p>

<p><b>The Sight of the Bumblebee.</b>&mdash;The large eyes located on the
sides of the head are made up of a large number of little units, each of
which is considered to be a very simple eye. The large eyes are therefore
called the <i>compound eyes</i>. All insects are provided with compound
eyes, with simple eyes, or in most cases with both. The simple eyes of the
bee may be found by a careful observer between and above the compound
eyes.<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
38]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">

 <p class="captionj"> The head of a bee. <i>A</i>, antennæ or "feelers";
 <i>E</i>, compound eye; <i>S</i>, simple eye; <i>M</i>, mouth parts;
 <i>T</i>, tongue.</p>
</div>

<p>Insects can, as we have already learned, distinguish differences in
color at some distance; they can see <i>moving</i> objects, but they do not
seem to be able to make out form well. To make up for this, they appear to
have an extremely well-developed sense of smell. Insects can distinguish at
a great distance odors which to the human nose are indistinguishable.
Night-flying insects, especially, find the flowers by the odor rather than
by color.</p>

<p><b>Mouth Parts of the Bee.</b>&mdash;The mouth of the bee is adapted to
take in the foods we have mentioned, and is used for the purposes for which
man would use the hands and fingers. The honeybee laps or sucks nectar from
flowers, it chews the pollen, and it uses part of the mouth as a trowel in
making the honeycomb. The uses of the mouth parts may be made out by
watching a bee on a well-opened flower.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Suggestions for Field Work.</b>&mdash;In any locality
where flowers are abundant, try to answer the following questions: How many
bees visit the locality in ten minutes? How many other insects alight on
the flowers? Do bees visit flowers of the same kinds in succession, or fly
from one flower on a given plant to another on a plant of a different kind?
If the bee lights on a flower cluster, does it visit more than one flower
in the same cluster? How does a bee alight? Exactly what does the bee do
when it alights?</p>

<p><b>Butter and Eggs</b> (<i>Linaria vulgaris</i>).&mdash;From July to
October this very abundant weed may be found especially along roadsides <a
name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>and in
sunny fields. The flower cluster forms a tall and conspicuous cluster of
orange and yellow flowers.</p>

<p>The corolla projects into a spur on the lower side; an upper two-parted
lip shuts down upon a lower three-parted lip. The four stamens are in

 <p class="captionj"> Diagram to show how the bee pollinates "butter
 and eggs." The bumblebee, upon entering the flower, rubs its head
 against the long pair of anthers (<i>a</i>), then continuing to
 press into the flower so as to reach the nectar at (<i>N</i>) it
 brushes against the stigma (<i>S</i>), thus pollinating the
 flower. Inasmuch as bees visit other flowers in the same cluster,
 cross-pollination would also be likely. Why?</p>
</div>

<p>Certain parts of the corolla are more brightly colored than the rest of
the flower. This color is a guide to insects. Butter and eggs is visited
most by bumblebees, which are guided by the orange lip to alight just where
they can push their way into the flower. The bee, seeking the nectar
secreted in the spur, brushes his head and shoulders against the stamens.
He may then, as he pushes down after nectar, leave some pollen upon the
pistil, thus assisting in <i>self-pollination</i>. Visiting another flower
of the cluster, it would be an easy matter accidentally to transfer <a
name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>this
pollen to the stigma of another flower. In this way pollen is carried by
the insect to another flower of the same kind. This is known as
<i>cross-pollination</i>. <i>By pollination we mean the transfer of pollen
from an anther to the stigma of a flower. Self-pollination is the transfer
of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower;
cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anthers of one flower
to the stigma of another flower on the same or another plant of the same
kind.</i></p>

 Charles Darwin worked out his theory of cross-pollination by
 insects.</p>
</div>

<p><b>History of the Discoveries regarding Pollination of
Flowers.</b>&mdash;Although the ancient Greek and Roman naturalists had
some vague ideas on the subject of pollination, it was not until the first
part of the nineteenth century that a book appeared in which a German named
Conrad Sprengel worked out the facts that the structure of certain flowers
seemed to be adapted to the visits of insects. Certain facilities were
offered to an insect in the way of easy foothold, sweet odor, and
especially food in the shape of pollen and nectar, the latter a
sweet-tasting substance manufactured by certain parts of the flower known
as the nectar glands. Sprengel further discovered the fact that pollen
could be and was carried by the insect visitors from the anthers of the
flower to its stigma. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth
century, however, that an Englishman, Charles Darwin, applied Sprengel's
discoveries on the relation of insects to flowers by his investigations
upon cross-pollination. The growth of the pollen on the stigma of the
flower results eventually in the production of seeds, <a name="Page_41"
id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>and thus new plants.
Many species of flowers are self-pollinated and do not do so well in seed
production if cross-pollinated, but Charles Darwin found that some flowers
which were self-pollinated did not produce so many seeds, and that the
plants which grew from their seeds were smaller and weaker than plants from
seeds produced by cross-pollinated flowers of the same kind. He also found
that plants grown from cross-pollinated seeds tended to <i>vary</i> more
than those grown from self-pollinated seed. This has an important bearing,
as we shall see later, in the production of new varieties of plants.
Microscopic examination of the stigma at the time of pollination also shows
that the pollen from another flower usually germinates before the pollen
which has fallen from the anthers of the same flower. This latter fact
alone in most cases renders it unlikely for a flower to produce seeds by
its own pollen. Darwin worked for years on the pollination of many
insect-visited flowers, and discovered in almost every case that showy,
sweet-scented, or otherwise attractive flowers were adapted or fitted to be
cross-pollinated by insects. He also found that, in the case of flowers
that were inconspicuous in appearance, often a compensation appeared in the
odor which rendered them attractive to certain insects. The so-called
carrion flowers, pollinated by flies, are examples, the odor in this case
being like decayed flesh. Other flowers open at night, are white, and
provided with a powerful scent. Thus they attract night-flying moths and
other insects.</p>

<p><b>Other Examples of Mutual Aid between Flowers and
Insects.</b>&mdash;Many other examples of adaptations to secure
cross-pollination by means of the visits of insects might be given. The
mountain laurel, which makes our hillsides so beautiful in late spring,
shows a remarkable adaptation in having the anthers of the stamens caught
in little pockets of the corolla. The weight of the visiting insect on the
corolla releases the anther from the pocket in which it rests so that it
springs up, dusting the body of the visitor with pollen.</p>

 <p class="captionj">The condition of stamens and pistils on the spiked
 loosestrife (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>In some flowers, as shown by the primroses or primula of our hothouses,
the stamens and pistils are of different lengths in different flowers.
Short styles and long or high-placed filaments are found in one flower, and
long styles with short or low-placed filaments <a name="Page_42"
id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>in the other.
Pollination will be effected only when some of the pollen from a low-placed
anther reaches the stigma of a short-styled flower, or when the pollen from
a high anther is placed upon a long-styled pistil. There are, as in the
case of the loosestrife, flowers having pistils and stamens of three
lengths. Pollen only grows on pistils of the same length as the stamens
from which it came.</p>

<p>The milkweed or butterfly weed already mentioned is another example of a
flower adapted to insect pollination.<a name= "fnanchor_1" id=

 <p class="caption">The pronuba moth within the yucca flower.</p>
</div>

<p>A very remarkable instance of insect help is found in the pollination of
the yucca, a semitropical lily which lives in deserts (to be seen in most
botanic gardens). In this flower the stigmatic surface is above the anther,
and the pollen is sticky and cannot be transferred except by insect aid.
This is accomplished in a remarkable manner. A little moth, called the
<i>pronuba</i>, after gathering pollen from an anther, deposits an egg in
the ovary of the pistil, and then rubs its load of pollen over the stigma
of the flower. The young hatch out and feed on the young seeds which have
grown because of the pollen placed on the stigma by the mother. The baby
caterpillars <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
43]</span>eat some of the developing seeds and later bore out of the seed
pod and escape to the ground, leaving the plant to develop the remaining
seeds without further molestation.</p>

<p>The fig insect (<i>Blastophaga grossorum</i>) is another member of the
insect tribe that is of considerable economic importance. It is only in
recent years that the fruit growers of California have discovered that the
fertilization of the female flowers is brought about by a gallfly which
bores into the young fruit. By importing the gallflies it has been possible
to grow figs where for many years it was believed that the climate
prevented figs from ripening.</p>

<p><b>Other Flower Visitors.</b>&mdash;Other insects besides those already
mentioned are pollen carriers for flowers. Among the most useful are moths
and butterflies. Projecting from each side of the head of a butterfly is a
fluffy structure, the palp. This collects and carries a large amount of
pollen, which is deposited upon the stigmas of other flowers when the
butterfly pushes its head down into the flower tube after nectar. The
scales and hairs on the wings, legs, and body also carry pollen.</p>

 <p class="caption"> A humming bird about to<br /> cross-pollinate a

</div>

<p>Flies and some other insects are agents in cross-pollination. Humming
birds are also active agents in <a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>some flowers. Snails are said in rare
instances to carry pollen. Man and the domesticated animals undoubtedly
frequently pollinate flowers by brushing past them through the fields.</p>

<p><b>Pollination by the Wind.</b>&mdash;Not all flowers are dependent upon
insects or other animals for cross-pollination. Many of the earliest of
spring flowers appear almost before the insects do. Such flowers are
dependent upon the wind for carrying pollen from the stamens of one flower
to the pistil of another. Most of our common trees, oak, poplar, maple, and
others, are cross-pollinated almost entirely by the wind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">A cornfield showing staminate and pistillate flowers,
 the latter having become grains of corn. An ear of corn is a bunch of
 ripened fruits.</p>
</div>

<p>Flowers pollinated by the wind are generally inconspicuous and often
lack a corolla. The anthers are exposed to the wind and provided with much
pollen, while the surface of the stigma may be long and feathery. Such
flowers may also lack odor, nectar, and bright color. Can you tell why?</p>

<p><b>Imperfect Flowers.</b>&mdash;Some flowers, the wind-pollinated ones
in particular, are imperfect; that is, they lack either stamens <a
name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>or
pistils. Again, in some cases, imperfect flowers having stamens only are
alone found on one plant, while those flowers having pistils only are found
on another plant of the same kind. In such flowers, cross-pollination must
of necessity follow. Many of our common trees are examples.</p>

<p><b>Other Cases.</b>&mdash;The stamens and pistil ripen at different
times in some flowers. The "Lady Washington" geranium, a common house
plant, shows this condition. Here also cross-pollination must take place if
seeds are to be formed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 stamens and pistil ripen at different times, thus insuring
 cross-pollination. <i>A</i>, flower with ripe stamens; <i>B</i>, flower
 with stamens withered and ripe pistil.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;If we now collect our observations upon flowers
with a view to making a summary of the different devices flowers have
assumed to prevent self-pollination and to secure cross-pollination, we
find that they are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>(1) The stamens and pistils may be found in separate flowers, either
on the same or on different plants.</i></p>

<p><i>(2) The stamens may produce pollen before the pistil is ready to
receive it, or vice versa.</i></p>

<p><i>(3) The stamens and pistils may be so placed with reference to each
other that pollination can be brought about only by outside assistance.</i>
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p><b>Artificial Cross-pollination and its Practical Benefits to
Man.</b>&mdash;Artificial cross-pollination is practiced by plant breeders
and can easily be tried in the laboratory or at home. First the anthers
must be carefully removed from the bud of the flower so as to eliminate all
possibility of self-pollination. The flower must then be covered so as to
prevent access of pollen from without; when the ovary is sufficiently
developed, pollen from another flower, having the characters desired, is
placed on the stigma and the flower again covered to prevent any other
pollen reaching the flower. The seeds from this flower when planted
<i>may</i> give rise to plants with the best characters of each of the
plants which contributed to the making of the seeds.</p>

THINGS</h3>

matter.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><b>A Living Plant and a Living Animal Compared.</b>&mdash;A
walk into the fields or any vacant lot on a day in the early fall will give
us first-hand acquaintance with many common plants which, because of their
ability to grow under somewhat unfavorable conditions, are called
<i>weeds</i>. Such plants&mdash;the dandelion, butter and eggs, the
shepherd's purse&mdash;are particularly well fitted by nature to produce
many of their kind, and by this means drive out other plants which cannot
do this so well. On these or other plants we find feeding several kinds of
animals, usually insects.</p>

<p>If we attempt to compare, for example, a grasshopper with the plant on
which it feeds, we see several points of likeness and difference at once.
Both plant and insect are made up of parts, each of which, as the stem of
the plant or the leg of the insect, appears to be distinct, but which is a
part of the whole living plant or animal. Each part of the living plant or
animal which has a separate work to do is called an <i>organ</i>. Thus
plants and animals are spoken of as living <i>organisms</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
48]</span><b>Functions of the Parts of a Plant.</b>&mdash;We are all
familiar with the parts of a plant,&mdash;the root, stem, leaves, flowers,
and fruit. But we may not know so much about their uses to the plant. Each
of these structures differs from every other part, and each has a separate
work or function to perform for the plant. <i>The root holds the plant
firmly in the ground and takes in water and mineral matter from the soil;
the stem holds the leaves up to the light and acts as a pathway for fluids
between the root and leaves; the leaves, under certain conditions,
manufacture food for the plant and breathe; the flowers form the fruits;
the fruits hold the seeds, which in turn hold young plants which are
capable of reproducing adult plants of the same kind.</i></p>

<p><b>The Functions of an Animal.</b>&mdash;As we have already seen, the
grasshopper has a head, a jointed body composed of a middle and a hind
part, three pairs of jointed legs, and two pairs of wings. Obviously, the
wings and legs are used for movement; a careful watching of the hind part
of the animal shows us that breathing movements are taking place; a bit of
grass placed before it may be eaten, the tiny black jaws biting little
pieces out of the grass. If disturbed, the insect hops away, and if we try
to get it, it jumps or flies away, evidently seeing us before we can grasp
it. Hundreds of little grasshoppers on the grass indicate that the
grasshopper can reproduce its own kind, but in other respects the animal
seems quite unlike the plant. The animal moves, breathes, feeds, and has
sensation, while <i>apparently</i> the plant does none of these. It will be
the purpose of later chapters to prove that the functions of plants and
animals are in many respects similar and that <i>both plants</i> and
<i>animals breathe</i>, <i>feed</i>, and <i>reproduce</i>.</p>

<p><b>Organs.</b>&mdash;If we look carefully at the organ of a plant called
a leaf, we find that the materials of which it is composed do not appear <a
name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>to be
everywhere the same. The leaf is much thinner and more delicate in some
parts than in others. Holding the flat, expanded blade away from the branch
is a little stalk, which extends into the blade of the leaf. Here it splits
up into a network of tiny "veins" which evidently form a framework for the
flat blade somewhat as the sticks of a kite hold the paper in place. If we
examine under the compound microscope a thin section cut across the leaf,
we shall find that the veins as well as the other parts are made up of many
tiny boxlike units of various sizes and shapes. These smallest units of
building material of the plant or animal disclosed by the compound
microscope are called <i>cells</i>. The organs of a plant or animal are
built of these tiny structures.</p>

<p><b>Tissues.</b><a name= "fnanchor_2" id= "fnanchor_2"></a><a href=
"#footnote_2" class= "fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;The cells which form certain
parts of the veins, the flat blade, or other portions of the plant, are
often found in groups or collections, the cells of which are more or less
alike <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
50]</span>in size and shape. Such a collection of cells is called a
<i>tissue</i>. Examples of tissues are the cells covering the outside of
the human body, the muscle cells, which collectively allow of movement,
bony tissues which form the framework to which the muscles are attached,
and many others.</p>

 wall; <i>n.</i>, nucleus; <i>p.</i>, protoplasm.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cells.</b>&mdash;<i>A cell may be defined as a tiny mass of living
matter containing a nucleus, either living alone or forming a unit of the
building material of a living thing.</i> The living matter of which all
cells are formed is known as <i>protoplasm</i> (formed from two Greek words
meaning <i>first form</i>). If we examine under a compound microscope a
small bit of the water plant <i>Elodea</i>, we see a number of structures
resembling bricks in a wall. Each "brick," however, is really a plant cell
bounded by a thin wall. If we look carefully, we can see that the material
inside of this wall is slowly moving and is carrying around in its
substance a number of little green bodies. This moving substance is living
matter, the protoplasm of the cell. The green bodies (the
<i>chlorophyll</i> bodies) we shall learn more about later; they are found
only in plant cells. All plant and animal cells appear to be alike in the
fact that every living cell possesses a structure known as the
<i>nucleus</i> (pl. <i>nuclei</i>), which is found within the body of the
cell. This nucleus is not easy to find in the cells of <i>Elodea</i>.
Within the nucleus of all cells are found certain bodies called
<i>chromosomes</i>. These chromosomes in a given plant or animal are always
constant in number. These chromosomes are supposed to be the bearers of the
qualities which we believe can be handed down from plant to plant and from
animal to animal, in other words, the inheritable qualities which make the
offspring like its parents.</p>

<p><b>How Cells form Others.</b>&mdash;Cells grow to a certain size and
then split into two new cells. In this process, which is of very great
importance in the growth of both plants and animals, the nucleus divides
first. The chromosomes also divide, each splitting lengthwise and the parts
going in equal numbers to each of the two cells <a name="Page_51"
id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>formed from the old
cell. In this way the matter in the chromosomes is divided equally between
the two new cells. Then the rest of the protoplasm separates, and two new
cells are formed. This process is known as <i>fission</i>. It is the usual
method of growth found in the tissues of plants and animals.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Stages in the division of one cell to form two. Which
 part of the cell divides first? What seems to become of the
 chromosomes?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cells of Various Sizes and Shapes.</b>&mdash;Plant cells and animal
cells are of very diverse shapes and sizes. There are cells so large that
they can easily be seen with the unaided eye; for example, the root hairs
of plants and eggs of some animals. On the other hand, cells may be so
minute, as in the case of the plant cells named bacteria, that several
million might be present in a few drops of milk. The forms of cells may be
extremely varied in different tissues; they may assume the form of cubes,
columns, spheres, flat plates, or may be extremely irregular in shape. One
kind of tissue cell, found in man, has a body so small as to be quite
invisible to the naked eye, although it has a prolongation several feet in
length. Such are some of the cells of the nervous system of man and other
large animals, as the ox, elephant, and whale.</p>

<p><b>Varying Sizes of Living Things.</b>&mdash;Plant cells and animal
cells may live alone, or they may form collections of cells. Some plants
are so simple in structure as to be formed of only one kind of cells.
Usually living organisms are composed of several groups of different kinds
of cells. It is only necessary to call attention to the fact that such
collections of cells may form organisms so tiny as to be barely visible to
the eye; as, for instance, some of the small flowerless plants or many of
the tiny animals living in fresh water or salt water. On the other hand,
among animals, the bulk of the elephant and whale, and among plants the big
trees of California, <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>stand out as notable examples. The large
plants and animals are made up of <i>more</i>, not necessarily larger,
cells.</p>

<p><b>What Protoplasm can Do.</b>&mdash;It responds to influences or
stimulation from without its own substance. Both plants and animals are
sensitive to touch or stimulation by light, heat or cold, certain chemical
substances, gravity, and electricity. Green plants turn toward the source
of light. Some animals are attracted to light and others repelled by it;
the earthworm is an example of the latter. <i>Protoplasm is thus said to be
irritable.</i></p>

<p><i>Protoplasm has the power to contract and to move.</i> Muscular
movement is a familiar instance of this power. Movement may also take place
in plants. Some plants fold up their leaves at night; others, like the
sensitive plant, fold their leaflets when touched.</p>

<p><i>Protoplasm can form new living matter out of food.</i> To do this,
food materials must be absorbed into the cells of the living organism. To
make protoplasm, it is evident that the same chemical elements must enter
into the composition of the food substances as are found in living matter.
The simplest plants and animals have this wonderful power as certainly
developed as the most complex forms of life.</p>

<p><i>Protoplasm, be it in plant or animal, breathes and throws off waste
materials.</i> When a living thing does work oxygen unites with food in the
body; the food is burned or <i>oxidized</i> and work is done by means of
the energy released from the food. The waste materials are <i>excreted</i>
or passed out. Plants and animals alike pass off the carbon dioxide which
results from the oxidation of food and of parts of their own bodies.
Animals eliminate wastes containing nitrogen through the skin and the
kidneys.</p>

<p><i>Protoplasm can reproduce, that is, form other matter like itself.</i>
New plants are constantly appearing to take the places of those that die.
The supply of living things upon the earth is not decreasing; reproduction
is constantly taking place. In a general way it is possible to say that
plants and animals reproduce in a very similar manner.</p>

<p><b>The Importance of Reproduction.</b>&mdash;Reproduction is the final
process that plants and animals are called upon to perform. <a
name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>Without
the formation of <i>new</i> living things no progress would be possible on
the earth. We have found that insects help flowering plants in this
process. Let us now see exactly what happens when pollen is placed by the
bee on the stigma of another flower of the same kind. To understand this
process of reproduction in flowers, we must first study carefully pollen
grains from the anther of some growing flower.</p>

 <p class="caption">Pollen grains of different shapes and sizes.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Pollen.</b>&mdash;Pollen grains of various flowers, when seen under
the microscope, differ greatly in form and appearance. Some are relatively
large, some small, some rough, others smooth, some spherical, and others
angular. They all agree, however, in having a thick wall, with a thin
membrane under it, the whole inclosing a mass of protoplasm. At an early
stage the pollen grain contains but a single cell. A little later, however,
two nuclei may be found in the protoplasm. Hence we know that at least two
cells exist there, one of which is called the sperm cell; its nucleus is
the sperm nucleus.</p>

<p><b>Growth of Pollen Grains.</b>&mdash;Under certain conditions a pollen
grain will grow or germinate. This growth can be artificially produced in
the laboratory by sprinkling pollen from well-opened flowers of sweet pea
or nasturtium on a solution of 15 parts of sugar to 100 of water. Left for
a few hours in a warm and moist place and then examined under the
microscope, the grains of pollen will be found to have germinated, a long,
threadlike mass of protoplasm growing from it into the sugar solution. <a
name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>The
presence of this sugar solution was sufficient to induce growth. When the
pollen grain germinates, the nuclei enter the threadlike growth (this
growth is called the pollen tube; see Figure). One of the nuclei which
grows into the pollen tube is known as the <i>sperm nucleus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Fertilization of the Flower.</b>&mdash;If we cut the pistil of a
large flower (as a lily) lengthwise, we notice that the style appears to be
composed of rather spongy material in the interior; the ovary is hollow and
is seen to contain a number of rounded structures which appear to grow out
from the wall of the ovary. These are the <i>ovules</i>. The ovules, under
certain conditions, will become <i>seeds</i>. An explanation of these
conditions may be had if we examine, under the microscope, a very thin
section of a pistil, on which pollen has begun to germinate. The central
part of the style is found to be either hollow or composed of a soft tissue
through which the pollen tube can easily grow.  Upon germination, the
pollen tube grows downward through the spongy center of the style, follows
the path of least resistance to the space within the ovary, and there
enters the ovule.  It is believed that some chemical influence <a
name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>thus
attracts the pollen tube. When it reaches the ovary, the sperm cell
penetrates an ovule by making its way through a little hole called the
<i>micropyle</i>. It then grows toward a clear bit of protoplasm known as
the <i>embryo sac</i>. The embryo sac is an ovoid space, microscopic in
size, filled with semifluid protoplasm containing several nuclei. (See
Figure.) <i>One of the nuclei, with the protoplasm immediately surrounding
it, is called the egg cell.</i> It is this cell that the sperm nucleus of
the pollen tube grows toward; ultimately the sperm nucleus reaches the egg
nucleus and unites with it. <i>The two nuclei, after coming together, unite
to form a single cell. This process is known as fertilization.</i> This
single cell formed by the union of the pollen tube cell or sperm and the
egg cell is now called a <i>fertilized egg</i>.</p>

<p><b>Development of Ovule into Seed.</b>&mdash;<i>The primary reason for
the existence of a flower is that it may produce seeds from which future
plants will grow. After fertilization the ovule grows into a seed.</i> The
first beginning of the growth of the seed takes place at the moment of
fertilization. From that time on there is a growth of the fertilized egg
within the ovule which makes a baby plant called the <i>embryo</i>. <i>The
embryo will give rise to the adult plant.</i></p>

</div>

<p><b>A Typical Fruit,&mdash;the Pea or Bean Pod.</b>&mdash;If a withered
flower of any one of the pea or bean family is examined carefully, it will
be found that the pistil of the flower continues to grow after the rest of
the flower withers. If we remove the pistil from such a flower and examine
it carefully, we find that it is the ovary that has enlarged. The space
within the ovary has become nearly filled with a number of nearly ovoid
bodies, attached along one edge of the inner wall. These we recognize as
the young seeds.</p>

<p>The pod of a bean, pea, or locust illustrates well the growth from the
flower. The pod, which is in reality a ripened ovary with other parts of
the pistil attached to it, is considered as a <i>fruit</i>. By definition,
<i>a fruit is a ripened</i> <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span><i>ovary and its contents together with any
parts of the flower that may be attached to it</i>. The chief use of the
fruit to the flower is to hold and to protect the seeds; it may ultimately
distribute them where they can reproduce young plants.</p>

<p><b>The Necessity of Fruit and Seed Dispersal to a Plant.</b>&mdash;We
have seen that the chief reason for flowers, from the plant's standpoint,
is to produce fruits which contain seeds. Reproduction and the ultimate
scattering of fruits and seeds are absolutely necessary in order that
colonies of plants may reach new localities. It is evident that plants best
fitted to scatter their seeds, or place fruits containing the seeds some
little distance from the parent plants, are the ones which will spread most
rapidly. A plant, if it is to advance into new territory, must get its
seeds there first. Plants which are best fitted to do this are the most
widely distributed on the earth.</p>

 additional parts besides the ovary (<i>o</i>) become part of the fruit.
 Certain outer parts of the flower, the sepals (<i>s</i>) and receptacle,
 become the fleshy part of the fruit, while the ovary becomes the core.
 Stages numbered 1 to 7 are in the order of development.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How Seeds and Fruits are Scattered.</b>&mdash;Seed dispersal is
accomplished in many different ways. Some plants produce enormous numbers
of seeds which may or may not have special devices to aid in their
scattering. Most weeds are thus started "in pastures <a name="Page_57"
id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>new." Some prolific
plants, like the milkweed, have <i>seeds</i> with a little tuft of hairlike
down which allows them to be carried by the wind. Others, as the
omnipresent dandelion, have their <i>fruits</i> provided with a similar
structure, the pappus. Some plants, as the burdock and clotbur, have fruits
provided with tiny hooks which stick to the hair of animals, thus proving a
means of transportation. Most fleshy fruits contain indigestible seeds, so
that when the fruits are eaten by animals the seeds are passed off from the
body unharmed and may, if favorably placed, grow. Nuts of various kinds are
often carried off by animals, buried, and forgotten, to grow later. Such
are a few of the ways in which seeds are scattered. All other things being
equal, the plants best equipped to scatter seeds or fruits are those which
will drive out other plants in a given locality. Because of their
adaptations they are likely to be very numerous, and when unfavorable
conditions come, for that reason, if for no other, are likely to survive.
Such plants are best exemplified in the weeds of the grassplots and
gardens.</p>

 <i>To the Teacher.</i>&mdash;Any simple plant or animal tissue can be used
 to demonstrate the cell. Epidermal cells may be stripped from the body of
 the frog or obtained by scraping the inside of one's mouth. The thin skin
 from an onion stained with tincture of iodine shows well, as do thin
 sections of a young stem, as the bean or pea. One of the best places to
 study a tissue and the cells of which it is composed is in the leaf of a
 green water plant, <i>Elodea</i>. In this plant the cells are large, and
 not only their outline, but the movement of the living matter within the
 cells, may easily be seen, and the parts described in the next paragraph
 can be demonstrated.</p>

59]</span>formed in the seed as the result of the fertilization of the egg
cell, is able to grow into an adult plant. Two sets of factors are
necessary for its growth: first, the presence of food to give the young
plant a start; second, certain stimulating factors outside the young plant,
such as water and heat.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Three views of a kidney bean, the lower one having one
 cotyledon removed to show the hypocotyl and plumule.</p>
</div>

<p>If we open a bean pod, we find the seeds lying along one edge of the
pod, each attached by a little stalk to the inner wall of the ovary. If we
pull a single bean from its attachment, we find that the stalk leaves a
scar on the coat of the bean; this scar is called the <i>hilum</i>. The
tiny hole near the hilum is called the <i>micropyle</i>. Turn back to the
figure (page <a href="#Page_54">54</a>) showing the ovule in the ovary.
Find there the little hole through which the pollen tube reached the embryo
sac. This hole is identical with the micropyle in the seed. The thick outer
coat (the <i>testa</i>) is easily removed from a soaked bean, the delicate
coat under it easily escaping notice. The seed separates into two parts;
these are called the <i>cotyledons</i>. If you pull apart the cotyledons
very carefully, you find certain other structures between them. The rodlike
part is called the <i>hypocotyl</i> (meaning <i>under the cotyledons</i>).
This will later form the root (and part of the stem) of the young bean
plant. The first true leaves, very tiny structures, are folded together
between the cotyledons. That part of the plant above the cotyledons is
known as the <i>plumule</i> or <i>epicotyl</i> (meaning <i>above the
cotyledons</i>). All the parts of the seed within the seed coats together
form the <i>embryo</i> or young plant. A bean seed contains, then, a tiny
<i>plant</i> protected by a tough coat.</p>

<p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
60]</span><b>Food in the Cotyledons.</b>&mdash;The problem now before us is
to find out how the embryo of the bean is adapted to grow into an adult
plant. Up to this stage of its existence it has had the advantage of food
and protection from the parent plant. Now it must begin the battle of life
alone. We shall find in all our work with plants and animals that the
problem of food supply is always the most important problem to be solved by
the growing organism. Let us see if the embryo is able to get a start in
life (which many animals get in the egg) from food provided for it within
its own body.</p>

<p><b>Organic Nutrients.</b>&mdash;Organic foods (those which come from
living sources) are made up of two kinds of substances, the
<i>nutrients</i> or food substances and <i>wastes</i> or <i>refuse</i>. An
egg, for example, contains the white and the yolk, composed of nutrients,
and the shell, which is waste. The organic nutrients are classed in three
groups.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px">

 <p class="caption">Starch grains in the cells of a potato tuber.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Carbohydrates</i>, foods which contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
in a certain fixed proportion (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is
an example). They are the simplest of these very complex chemical compounds
we call organic nutrients. Starch and sugar are common examples of
carbohydrates.</p>

<p><i>Fats and Oils.</i>&mdash;These foods are also composed of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen in a proportion which enables them to unite readily
with oxygen.</p>

<p><i>Proteins.</i>&mdash;A third group of organic foods, proteins, are the
most complex of all in their composition, and have, besides carbon, oxygen,
and hydrogen, the element nitrogen and minute quantities of other
elements.</p>

<p><b>Test for Starch.</b>&mdash;If we boil water with a piece of laundry
starch in a test tube, then cool it and add to the mixture two or three
drops of iodine solution,<a name= "fnanchor_3" id= "fnanchor_3"></a><a
href= "#footnote_3" class= "fnanchor">[3]</a> we find that the mixture in
the test tube <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
61]</span>turns purple or deep blue. It has been discovered by experiment
that starch, and no <i>other known substance</i>, will be turned purple or
dark blue by iodine. Therefore, iodine solution has come to be used as a
test for the presence of starch.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px">

 width="200" height="231"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Test for Starch.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Starch in the Bean.</b>&mdash;If we mash up a little piece of a bean
cotyledon which has been previously soaked in water, and test for starch
with iodine solution, the characteristic blue-black color appears, showing
the presence of the starch. If a little of the stained material is mounted
in water on a glass slide under the compound microscope, you will find that
the starch is in the form of little ovoid bodies called <i>starch
grains</i>. The starch grains and other food products are made use of by
the growing plant.</p>

 <p class="caption">Test for protein.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Test for Oils.</b>&mdash;If the substance believed to contain oil is
rubbed on brown paper or is placed on paper and then heated in an oven, the
presence of oil will be known by a translucent spot on the paper.</p>

<p><b>Protein in the Bean.</b>&mdash;Another nutrient present in the bean
cotyledon is <i>protein</i>. Several tests are used to detect the presence
of this nutrient. The following is one of the best known:&mdash;</p>

<p>Place in a test tube the substance to be tested; for example, a bit of
hard-boiled egg. Pour over it a little strong (60 per cent) nitric acid and
heat gently. Note the color that appears&mdash;a lemon yellow. If the egg
is washed in water and a little ammonium hydrate added, the color changes
to a deep orange, showing that a protein is present.</p>

<p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
62]</span>If the protein is in a liquid state, its presence may be proved
by heating, for when it coagulates or thickens, as does the white of an egg
when boiled, protein in the form of an <i>albumin</i> is present.</p>

<p>Another characteristic protein test easily made at home is burning the
substance. If it burns with the odor of burning feathers or leather, then
protein forms part of its composition.<a name= "fnanchor_4" id=
"fnanchor_4"></a><a href= "#footnote_4" class= "fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A test of the cotyledon of a bean for protein food with nitric acid and
ammonium hydrate shows us the presence of this food. Beans are found by
actual test to contain about 23 per cent of protein, 59 per cent of
carbohydrates, and about 2 per cent oils. The young plant within a pea or
bean is thus shown to be well supplied with nourishment until it is able to
take care of itself. In this respect it is somewhat like a young animal
within the egg, a bird or fish, for example.</p>

<p><b>Beans and Peas as Food for Man.</b>&mdash;So much food is stored in
legumes (as beans and peas) that man has come to consider them a very
valuable and cheap source of food. Study carefully the following

<p><b>Germination of the Bean.</b>&mdash;If dry seeds are planted in
sawdust or earth, they will not grow. A moderate supply of water must be
given to them. If seeds were to be kept in a freezing temperature or at a
very high temperature, no growth would take place. A moderate temperature

 used up all of the food supply in the cotyledons.</p>
</div>

<p>If some beans were planted so that we might make a record of their
growth, we would find the first signs of germination to be the breaking of
the testa and the pushing outward of the hypocotyl to form the first root.
A little later the hypocotyl begins to curve downward. A later stage shows
the hypocotyl lifting the cotyledon upward. In consequence the hypocotyl
forms an arch, dragging after it the bulky cotyledons. The stem, as soon as
it is released from the <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>ground, straightens out. From between the
cotyledons the budlike plumule or epicotyl grows upward, forming the first
true leaves and all of the stem above the cotyledons. As growth continues,
we notice that the cotyledons become smaller and smaller, until their food
contents are completely absorbed into the young plant. The young plant is
now able to care for itself and may be said to have passed through the
stages of germination.</p>

<p><b>What makes an Engine Go.</b>&mdash;If we examine the sawdust or soil
in which the seeds are growing, we find it forced up by the growing seed.
Evidently work was done; in other words, <i>energy</i> was released by the
seeds. A familiar example of release of energy is seen in an engine. Coal
is placed in the firebox and lighted, the lower door of the furnace is then
opened so as to make a draft of air which will reach the coal. You know the
result. The coal burns, heat is given off, causing the water in the boiler
to make steam, the engine wheels to turn, and work to be done. Let us see
what happens from the chemical standpoint.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Coal, Organic Matter.</b>&mdash;Coal is made largely from dead
plants, long since pressed into its present hard form. It contains a large
amount of a chemical element called carbon, the presence of which is
characteristic of all organic material.</p>

<p><b>Oxidation, its Results.</b>&mdash;When things containing carbon are
lighted, they burn. If we place a lighted candle which contains carbon in a
closed glass jar, the candle soon goes out. If we then carefully test the
air in the jar with a substance known as <i>limewater</i>,<a name=
"fnanchor_5" id= "fnanchor_5"></a><a href= "#footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> the latter, when shaken up with the air in the jar,
turns milky. This test proves the presence in the jar of a gas, known as
<i>carbon dioxide</i>. This gas is formed by the carbon of the candle
uniting with the oxygen in <a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>the air. When the oxygen of the air in the
jar was used up, the flame went out, showing that oxygen is necessary to
make a thing burn. This uniting of oxygen with some other substance is
called <i>oxidation</i>.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Diagram to show that when a piece of wood is burned it
 forms water and carbon dioxide.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Oxidation possible without a Flame</b>.&mdash;But a flame is not
necessary for oxidation. Iron, if left in a damp place, becomes rusty. A
union between the oxygen in the water or air and the iron makes what is
known as iron oxide or rust. This is an example of <i>slow
oxidation</i>.</p>

<p><b>Oxidation in our Bodies.</b>&mdash;If we expel the air from our lungs
through a tube into a bottle of limewater, we notice the limewater becomes
milky. Evidently carbon dioxide is formed in our own bodies and oxidation
takes place there. Is it fair to believe that the heat of our body (for
example, 98.6° Fahrenheit under the tongue) is due to oxidation within the
body, and that the work we do results from this chemical process. If so,
what is oxidized?</p>

<p><b>Energy comes from Foods.</b>&mdash;From the foregoing experiment it
is evident that food is oxidized within the human body to release energy
for our daily work. Is it not logical to suppose that all living things,
both plant and animal, release energy as the result of oxidation of foods
within their cells? Let us see if this is true in the case of the pea.</p>

<p><b>Food oxidized in Germinating Seeds.</b>&mdash;If we take equal
numbers of soaked peas, placed in two bottles, one tightly stoppered, the
other having no stopper, both bottles being exposed to identical conditions
of light, temperature, and moisture, we find that the seeds in both bottles
start to germinate, but that those in the closed bottle soon stop, while
those in the open jar continue to grow almost as well as similar seeds
placed in an open dish would.</p>

 <p class="caption">Experiment that shows the necessity for air in
 germination.</p>
</div>

<p>Why did not the seeds in the covered jar germinate? To answer this
question, let us carefully remove the stopper from the stoppered jar and
insert a lighted candle. The candle goes out <a name="Page_66"
id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>at once. The surer
test of limewater shows the presence of carbon dioxide in the jar. The
carbon of the foodstuffs of the pea united with the oxygen of the air,
forming carbon dioxide. Growth stopped as soon as the oxygen was exhausted.
The presence of carbon dioxide in the jar is an indication that a very
important process which we associate with animals rather than plants, that
of <i>respiration</i>, is taking place. The seed, in order to release the
energy locked up in its food supply, must have oxygen, so that the
oxidation of the food may take place. <i>Hence a constant supply of fresh
air is an important factor in germination.</i> It is important that air
should penetrate between the grains of soil around a seed. The frequent
stirring of the soil enables the air to reach the seed. Air also acts upon
some materials in the soil and puts them in a form that the germinating
seed can use. This necessity for oxygen shows us at least one reason why
the farmer plows and harrows a field and one important use of the
earthworm. Explain.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Structure of a Grain of Corn.</b>&mdash;Examination of a well-soaked
grain of corn discloses a difference in the two flat sides of the grain. A
light-colored area found on one surface marks the position of the embryo;
the rest of the grain contains the food supply. The interesting thing to
remember here is that the food supply is <i>outside</i> of the embryo.</p>

<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>A
grain cut lengthwise perpendicular to the flat side and then dipped in weak
iodine shows two distinct parts, an area containing considerable starch,
the <i>endosperm</i>, and the embryo or young plant. Careful inspection
shows the hypocotyl and plumule (the latter pointing toward the free end of
the grain) and a part surrounding them, the <i>single</i> cotyledon (see
Figure). Here again we have an example of a fitting for future needs, for
in this fruit the one seed has at hand all the food material necessary for
rapid growth, although the food is here outside the embryo.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Endosperm the Food Supply of Corn.</b>&mdash;We find that the one
cotyledon of the corn grain does not serve the same purpose to the young
plant as do the two cotyledons of the bean. Although we find a little
starch in the corn cotyledon, still it is evident from our tests that the
endosperm is the chief source of food supply. The study of a thin section
of the corn grain under the compound microscope shows us that the starch
grains in the endosperm are large and regular in size. When the grain has
begun to grow, examination shows that the starch grains near the edge of
the cotyledon are much smaller and quite irregular, having large holes in
them. We know that the germinating grain has a much sweeter taste than that
which is not growing. This is noticed in sprouting barley or malt. We shall
later find that, in order to make use of starchy food, a plant or animal
must in some manner change it over to sugar. This change is necessary,
because starch will not dissolve in water, while sugar will; in this form
substances can pass from cell to cell in the plant and thus distribute the
food where it is needed.<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span

 <p class="caption">Test for grape sugar.</p>
</div>

<p><b>A Test for Grape Sugar.</b>&mdash;Place in a test tube the substance
to be tested and heat it in a little water so as to dissolve the sugar. Add
to the fluid twice its bulk of Fehling's solution,<a name= "fnanchor_6" id=
"fnanchor_6"></a><a href= "#footnote_6" class= "fnanchor">[6]</a> which has
been previously prepared. Heat the mixture, which should now have a blue
color, in the test tube. If grape sugar is present in considerable
quantity, the contents of the tube will turn first a greenish, then yellow,
and finally a brick-red color. Smaller amounts will show less decided red.
No other substance than sugar will give this reaction. If Benedict's test<a
name= "fnanchor_7" id= "fnanchor_7"></a><a href= "#footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> is used, a colored precipitate will appear in the test
tube after boiling.</p>

<p><b>Starch changed to Grape Sugar in the Corn.</b>&mdash;That starch is
being changed to grape sugar in the germinating corn grain can easily be
shown if we cut lengthwise through the embryos of half a dozen grains of
corn that have just begun to germinate, place them in a test tube with some
Fehling's solution, and heat almost to the boiling point. They will be
found to give a reaction showing the presence of sugar along the edge of
the cotyledon and between it and the endosperm.</p>

<p><b>Digestion.</b>&mdash;This change of starch to grape sugar in the corn
is a process of <i>digestion</i>. If you chew a bit of unsweetened cracker
in the mouth for a little time, it will begin to taste sweet, and if the
chewed cracker, which we know contains starch, is tested with Fehling's
solution, some of the starch will be found to have changed to grape sugar.
Here, again, a process of digestion has taken place. In both the corn and
in the mouth, the change is brought about by the action of peculiar
substances known as digestive ferments, or <i>enzymes</i>. Such substances
have the power under certain conditions to change insoluble
foods&mdash;solids&mdash;into <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>soluble substances&mdash;liquids. The result
is that substances which before digestion would not dissolve in water now
will dissolve.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Action of Diastase on Starch.</b>&mdash;The enzyme found in the
cotyledon of the corn, which changes starch to grape sugar, is called
<i>diastase</i>. It may be separated from the cotyledon and used in the
form of a powder.</p>

<p>To a little starch in half a cup of water we add a very little (1 gram)
of diastase and put the vessel containing the mixture in a warm place,
where the temperature will remain nearly constant at about 98° Fahrenheit.
On testing part of the contents at the end of half an hour, and the
remainder the next morning, for starch and for grape sugar, we find from
the morning test that the starch has been almost completely changed to
grape sugar. Starch and warm water alone under similar conditions will not
react to the test for grape sugar.</p>

<p><b>Digestion has the Same Purpose in Plants and Animals.</b>&mdash;In
our own bodies we know that solid foods taken into the mouth are broken up
by the teeth and moistened by saliva. If we could follow that food, we
would find that eventually it became part of the blood. It was made soluble
by digestion, and in a liquid form was able to reach the blood. Once a part
of the body, the food is used either to release energy or to build up the
body.</p>

<p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;We have seen:

1. That seeds, in order to grow, must possess a food supply either in or
around their bodies.</p>

<p>2. That this food supply must be oxidized before energy is released.</p>

<p>3. That in cases where the food is not stored at the point where it is
to be oxidized the food must be digested so that it may be transported from
one part to another in the same plant.</p>

<p><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
70]</span>The life processes of plants and animals, so far, may be
considered as alike; they both feed, breathe (oxidize their food), do work,
and grow.</p>

 Iodine solution is made by simply adding a few crystals of the element
 iodine to 95 per cent alcohol; or, better, take by weight 1 gram of iodine
 crystals, 2/3 gram of iodide of potassium, and dilute to a dark brown
 color in weak alcohol (35 per cent) or distilled water.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Uses of the Root.</b>&mdash;If one of the seedlings of the
bean spoken of in the last chapter is allowed to grow in sawdust and is
given light, air, and water, sooner or later it will die. Soil is part of
its natural environment, and the roots which come in contact with the soil
are very important. It is the purpose of this chapter to find out just how
the young plant is fitted to get what it needs from this part of its
environment; namely, the soil.</p>

<p>The development of a bean seedling has shown us that the root grows
first. <i>One of the most important functions of the root to a young seed
plant is that of a holdfast, an anchor to fasten it in the place where it
is to develop.</i> It has many other uses, as the taking in of water with
the mineral and organic matter dissolved therein, the storage <a
name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>of
food, climbing, etc. All functions other than the first one stated arise
after the young plant has begun to develop.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A root system, showing primary and secondary roots.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Root System.</b>&mdash;If you dig up a young bean seedling and
carefully wash the dirt from the roots, you will see that a long root is
developed as a continuation of the hypocotyl. This root is called the
<i>primary</i> root. Other smaller roots which grow from the primary root
are called <i>secondary</i>, or <i>tertiary</i>, depending on their
relation to the first root developed.</p>

<p><b>Downward Growth of Root. Influence of Gravity.</b>&mdash;Most of the
roots examined take a more or less downward direction. We are all familiar
with the fact that the force we call gravity influences life upon this
earth to a great degree. Does gravity act on the growing root? This
question may be answered by a simple experiment.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px">
 <img src="images/i076b.jpg"
 width="200" height="264"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Revolve this figure in the direction of the arrows to
 see if the roots of the radish respond to gravity.</p>
</div>

<p>Plant mustard or radish seeds in a pocket garden, place it on one edge
and allow the seeds to germinate until the root has grown to a length of
about half an inch. Then turn it at right angles to the first position and
allow it to remain for one day undisturbed. The roots now will be found to
have turned in response to the change in position, that part of the root
near the growing point being the most sensitive to the change. This
experiment seems to indicate that the roots are influenced to grow downward
by the force of gravity.</p>

<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
73]</span><b>Experiments to determine the Influence of Moisture on a
Growing Root.</b>&mdash;The objection might well be interposed that
possibly the roots in the pocket garden<a name= "fnanchor_8" id=
"fnanchor_8"></a><a href= "#footnote_8" class= "fnanchor">[8]</a> grew
downward after water. That moisture has an influence on the growing root is
easily proved.</p>

<p>Plant bird seed, mustard or radish seed in the underside of a sponge,
which should be kept wet, and may be suspended by a string under a bell jar
in the schoolroom window. Note whether the roots leave the sponge to grow
downward, or if the moisture in the sponge is sufficient to counterbalance
the force of gravity.</p>

<p><b>Water a Factor which determines the Course taken by
Roots.</b>&mdash;<i>Water, as well as the force of gravity, has much to do
with the direction taken by roots.</i> Water is always found below the
surface of the ground, but sometimes at a great depth. Most trees, and all
grasses, have a greater area of surface exposed by the roots than by the
branches. The roots of alfalfa, a cloverlike plant used for hay in the
Western states, often penetrate the soil after water for a distance of ten
to twenty feet below the surface of the ground.</p>

<p><b>Fine Structure of a Root.</b><a name= "fnanchor_9" id=
"fnanchor_9"></a><a href= "#footnote_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;When we examine a delicate root in thin
longitudinal section under the compound microscope, we find the entire root
to be made up of cells, the walls of which are uniformly rather thin. Over
the lower end of the root is found a collection of cells, most of which are
dead, loosely arranged so as to form a cap over the growing tip. This is
evidently an adaptation which protects the young and actively growing cells
just under the root cap. In the body of the root a central cylinder can
easily be distinguished from the surrounding cells. In a longitudinal
section a series of tubelike structures may be found within the central
cylinder. These structures are cells which have grown together at the small
end, the long axis of the cells running <a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>the length of the main
root. In their development the cells mentioned have grown together in such
a manner as to lose their small ends, and now form continuous hollow tubes
with rather strong walls. Other cells have come to develop greatly
thickened walls; these cells give mechanical support to the tubelike cells.
Collections of such tubes and supporting woody cells together make up what
are known as <i>fibrovascular bundles</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Root Hairs.</b>&mdash;Careful examination of the root of one of the
seedlings of mustard, radish, or barley grown in the pocket germinator
shows a covering of tiny fuzzy structures. These structures are very
minute, at most 3 to 4 millimeters in length. They vary in length according
to their position on the root, the most and the longest root hairs being
found near the point marked <i>R. H.</i> in the figure. These structures
are outgrowths of the outer layer of the root (the <i>epidermis</i>), and
are of very great importance to the living plant.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Structure of a Root Hair.</b>&mdash;A single root hair examined under
a compound microscope will be found to be a long, round structure, almost
colorless in appearance. The wall, which is very flexible and thin, is made
up of cellulose, a substance somewhat like wood in chemical composition,
through which fluids may easily pass. Clinging close to the cell wall is
the protoplasm of the cell. The interior of the root hair is more or less
filled with a fluid <a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>called <i>cell sap</i>. Forming a part of the
living protoplasm of the root hair, sometimes in the hairlike prolongation
and sometimes in that part of the cell which forms the epidermis, is found
a <i>nucleus</i>. The protoplasm and nucleus are alive; the cell wall
formed by the living matter in the cell is dead. <i>The root hair is a
living plant cell</i> with a wall so delicate that water and mineral
substances from the soil can pass through it into the interior of the
root.</p>

<p><b>How the Root absorbs Water.</b>&mdash;The process by which the root
hair takes up soil water can better be understood if we make an artificial
root hair large enough to be easily seen. An egg with part of the outer
shell removed so as to expose the soft skinlike membrane underneath is an
example. Better, an artificial root hair may be <i>made</i> in the
following way. Pour some soft celloidin into a test tube; carefully revolve
the test tube so that an even film of celloidin dries on the inside. This
membrane is removed, filled with white of egg, and tied over the end of a
rubber cork in which a glass tube has previously been inserted. When placed
in water, it gives a very accurate picture of the root hair at work. After
a short time water begins to rise in the tube, having passed through the
film of celloidin. If grape sugar, salt, or some other substance which will
dissolve in water were placed in the water outside the artificial root
hair, it could soon be proved by test to pass through the wall and into the
liquid inside.</p>

<p><b>Osmosis.</b>&mdash;To explain this process we must remember that
gases and liquids of different densities, when separated by a membrane,
tend to flow toward each other and mingle, the greater flow always being in
the direction of the denser medium. <i>The process by which two gases or
fluids, separated by a membrane, tend to pass through the membrane and
mingle with each other, is called osmosis.</i> The method by which the root
hairs take up soil water is exactly <a name="Page_76"
id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>the same process. It
is by osmosis. The white of the egg is the best possible substitute for
living matter; the celloidin membrane separating the egg from the water is
much like the delicate membrane-like wall which separates the protoplasm of
the root hair from the water in the soil surrounding it. The fluid in the
root hair is denser than the soil water; hence the greater flow is toward
the interior of the root hair.<a name= "fnanchor_10" id=
"fnanchor_10"></a><a href= "#footnote_10" class= "fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

 <p class="captionj">The soil particles are each surrounded with a delicate
 film of water. How might the root hairs take up this water?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Passage of Soil Water within the Root.</b>&mdash;We have already seen
that in an exchange of fluids by osmosis the greater flow is always toward
the denser fluid. Thus it is that the root hairs take in more fluid than
they give up. The cell sap, which partly fills the interior of the root
hair, is a fluid of greater density than the water outside in the soil.
When the root hairs become filled with water, the density of the cell sap
is lessened, and the cells of the epidermis are thus in a position to pass
along their supply of water to the cells next to them and nearer to the
center of the root. These cells, in turn, become less dense than their
inside neighbors, and so the transfer of water goes on until the water at
last reaches the central cylinder. Here it is passed over to the tubes of
the woody bundles and started up the stem. The pressure created <a
name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>by this
process of osmosis is sufficient to send water up the stem to a distance,
in some plants, of 25 to 30 feet. Cases are on record of water having been
raised in the birch a distance of 85 feet.</p>

<p><b>Physiological Importance of Osmosis.</b>&mdash;It is not an
exaggeration to say that osmosis is a process not only of great importance
to a plant, but to an animal as well. Foods are digested in the food tube
of an animal; that is, they are changed into a soluble form so that they
may pass through the walls of the food tube and become part of the blood.
The inner lining of part of the food tube is thrown into millions of little
fingerlike projections which look somewhat, in size at least, like root
hairs. These fingerlike processes are (unlike a root hair) made up of many
cells. But they serve the same purpose as the root hairs, for they absorb
liquid food into the blood. This process of absorption is largely by
osmosis. Without the process of osmosis we should be unable to use much of
the food we eat.</p>

 <p class="caption">Inorganic soil is being formed by weathering.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Composition of Soil.</b>&mdash;If we examine a mass of ordinary loam
carefully, we find that it is composed of numerous particles of varying
size and weight. Between these particles, if the soil is not caked and hard
packed, we can find tiny spaces. In well-tilled soil these spaces are
constantly being formed and enlarged. They allow air and water to penetrate
the soil. If we examine soil under the microscope, we find considerable
water clinging to the soil particles and forming a delicate film around
each particle. In this manner most of the water is held in the soil.</p>

 <p class="captionj">This picture shows how the forests help to cover the
 inorganic soil with an organic coating. Explain how.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How Water is held in Soil.</b>&mdash;To understand what comes in with
the soil water, it will be necessary to find out a little more about soil.
Scientists who have made the subject of the composition of the earth a
study, <a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
78]</span>tell us that once upon a time at least a part of the earth was
molten. Later, it cooled into solid rock. Soil making began when the ice
and frost, working alternately with the heat, chipped off pieces of rock.
These pieces in time became ground into fragments by action of ice,
glaciers, running water, or the atmosphere. This process is called
weathering. Weathering is aided by oxidation. A glance at almost any
crumbling stones will convince you of this, because of the yellow oxide of
iron (rust) disclosed. So by slow degrees this earth became covered with a
coating of what we call inorganic soil. Later, generation after generation
of tiny plants and animals which lived in the soil died, and their remains
formed the first organic materials of the soil.</p>

</div>

<p>You are all familiar with the difference between the so-called rich soil
and poor soil. The dark soil contains more dead plant and animal matter,
which forms the portion called <i>humus</i>.</p>

<p><b>Humus contains Organic Matter.</b>&mdash;It is an <a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>easy matter to prove
that black soil contains organic matter, for if an equal weight of
carefully dried humus and soil from a sandy road is heated red-hot for some
time and then reweighed, the humus will be found to have lost considerably
in weight, and the sandy soil to have lost very little.  The material left
after heating is inorganic material, the organic matter having been burned
out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i083.jpg"
 width="250" height="341"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Soil particles cling to root hairs. Why?</p>
</div>

<p>Soil containing organic materials holds water much more readily than
inorganic soil, as a glance at the accompanying figure shows. If we fill
each of the vessels with a given weight (say 100 grams each) of gravel,
sand, barren soil, rich loam, leaf mold, and 25 grams of dry, pulverized
leaves, then pour equal amounts of water (100 c.c.) on each and measure all
that runs through, the water that has been retained will represent the
water supply that plants could draw on from such soil.</p>

<p><b>The Root Hairs take more than Water out of the Soil.</b>&mdash;If a
root containing a fringe of root hairs is washed carefully, it will be
found to have little particles of soil still clinging to it. Examined under
the microscope, these particles of soil seem to be cemented to the sticky
surface of the root hair. The soil contains, besides a number of chemical
compounds of various mineral substances,&mdash;lime, potash, iron, silica,
and many others,&mdash;a considerable amount of organic material. Acids of
various kinds are present in the soil. These acids so act upon certain of
the mineral substances that they become dissolved in the water which is
absorbed by the root hairs. Root hairs also give off small amounts of acid.
An interesting experiment may be shown (see Figure on page <a
href="#Page_80">80</a>) to prove this. A solution of <i>phenolphthalein</i>
loses its color when an acid is added to it. If a growing pea be placed in
a tube containing <a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>some of this solution the latter will quickly
change from a rose pink to a colorless solution.</p>

</div>

<p><b>A Plant needs Mineral Matter to Make Living Matter.</b>&mdash;Living
matter (protoplasm), besides containing the chemical elements carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, contains a very minute proportion of
various elements which make up the basis of certain minerals. These are
calcium (lime), sulphur, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium,
and chlorine.</p>

<p>That plants will not grow well without certain of these mineral
substances can be proved by the growth of seedlings in a so-called nutrient
solution.<a name= "fnanchor_11" id= "fnanchor_11"></a><a href=
"#footnote_11" class= "fnanchor">[11]</a> Such a solution contains all the
mineral matter that a plant uses for food. If certain ingredients are left
out of this solution, the plants placed in it will not live.</p>

<p><b>Nitrogen in a Usable Form necessary for Growth of Plants.</b>&mdash;A
chemical element needed by the plant to make protoplasm is nitrogen. The
air can be proven by experiment to be made up of about four fifths
nitrogen, but this element cannot be taken from either soil, water, or air
in a pure state, but is usually obtained from the organic matter in the
soil, where it exists with other substances in the form of <i>nitrates</i>.
Ammonia and other organic compounds which contain nitrogen are changed by
two groups of little plants called <i>bacteria</i>, first into nitrites and
then nitrates.<a name= "fnanchor_12" id= "fnanchor_12"></a><a href=

 <p class="captionj">Diagram to show how the nitrogen-fixing bacteria
 prepare nitrogen for use by plants; <i>t</i>, tubercles.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>
<b>Relation of Bacteria to Free Nitrogen.</b>&mdash;It has been known since
the time of the Romans that the growth of clover, peas, beans, and other
legumes in soil causes it to become more favorable for growth of other
plants. The reason for this has been discovered in late years. On the roots
of the plants mentioned are found little swellings or nodules; in the
nodules exist millions of bacteria, which take nitrogen from the atmosphere
and fix it so that it can be used by the plant; that is, they assist in
forming nitrates for the plants to use. Only these bacteria, of all the
living plants, have the power to take the free nitrogen from the air and
make it over into a form that can be used by the roots. As all the
compounds of nitrogen are used over and over again, first by plants, then
as food for animals, eventually returning to the soil again, or in part
being turned into free nitrogen, it is evident that any <i>new</i> supply
of usable nitrogen must come by means of these nitrogen-fixing
bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Rotation of Crops.</b>&mdash;The facts mentioned above are made use
of by careful farmers who wish to make as much as possible from a given
area of ground in a given time. Such plants as are hosts for the
nitrogen-fixing bacteria are planted early in the season. Later these
plants are plowed in and a second crop is planted. The latter grows quickly
and luxuriantly because of the nitrates left in the soil by the bacteria
which lived with the first crop. For this reason, clover is often grown on
land in which it is proposed <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>to plant corn, the nitrogen left in the soil
thus giving nourishment to the young corn plants. In scientifically managed
farms, different crops are planted in a given field on different years so
that one crop may replace some of the elements taken from the soil by the
previous crop. This is known as rotation of crops.<a name= "fnanchor_13"
id= "fnanchor_13"></a><a href= "#footnote_13" class= "fnanchor">[13]</a>
The annual yield of the average farm may thus be greatly increased.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Nitrogen in the soil is necessary for plants. Explain
 from this diagram how nitrogen is put into the soil by some plants and
 taken out by others.</p>
</div>

<p>Five of the elements necessary to the life of the plant which may be
taken out of the soil by constant use are calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, and sulphur. Several methods are used by the farmer to prevent
the exhaustion of these and other raw food materials from the soil. One
method known as <i>fallowing</i> is to allow the soil to remain idle until
bacteria and oxidation have renewed the chemical materials used by the
plants. This is an expensive method, if land is dear. The most common
method of enriching soil is by means of fertilizing material rich in plant
food. Manure is most frequently used, but many artificial fertilizers, most
of which contain nitrogen in the form of some nitrate, are used, because
they can be more easily transported and sold. Such are ground bone, guano
(bird manure), nitrate of soda, and many others. These also contain other
important raw food materials for plants, especially potash and phosphoric
acid. Both of these substances are made soluble so as to be taken into the
roots by the action of the carbon dioxide in the soil.</p>

<p><b>The Indirect Relation of this to the City Dweller.</b>&mdash;All of
us living in the city are aware of the importance of fresh vegetables, <a
name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>brought
in from the neighboring market gardens. But we sometimes forget that our
great staple crops, wheat and other cereals, potatoes, fruits of all kinds,
our cotton crop, and all plants we make use of grow directly in proportion
to the amount of raw food materials they take in through the roots. When we
also remember that many industries within the cities, as mills, bakeries,
and the like, as well as the earnings of our railways and steamship lines,
are largely dependent on the abundance of the crops, we may recognize the
importance of what we have read in this chapter.</p>

<p><b>Food Storage in Roots of Commercial Importance.</b>&mdash;Some
plants, as the parsnip, carrot, and radish, produce no seed until the
second year, storing food in the roots the first year and using it to get
an early start the following spring, so as to be better able to produce
seeds when the time comes. This food storage in roots is of much practical
value to mankind. Many of our commonest garden vegetables, as those
mentioned above, and the beet, turnip, oyster plant, sweet potato and many
others, are of value because of the food stored. The sugar beet has, in
Europe especially, become the basis of a great industry.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_8" id="footnote_8"></a> <a
href="#fnanchor_8">[8]</a> <i>The Pocket Garden.</i>&mdash;A very
convenient form of pocket germinator may be made as follows. Obtain two
cleaned four by five negatives (window glass will do); place one flat on
the table and place on this half a dozen pieces of colored blotting paper
cut to a size a little less than the glass. Now cut four thin strips of
wood to fit on the glass just outside of the paper.  Next moisten the
blotter, place on it some well-soaked radish, mustard seeds or barley
grains, and cover with the other glass. The whole box thus made should be
bound together with bicycle tape. Seeds will germinate in this box and with
care may live for two weeks or more.</p>

 It has recently been discovered that under some conditions these bacteria
 are preyed upon by tiny one-celled animals (<i>protozoa</i>) living in the
 soil and are so reduced in numbers that they cannot do their work
 effectively. If, then, the soil is heated artificially or treated with
 antiseptics so as to kill the protozoa, the bacteria which escape multiply
 so rapidly as to make the land much richer than before.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_13" id="footnote_13"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_13">[13]</a>
 That crop rotation is not primarily a process to conserve the fertility of
 the soil, but is a sanitary measure to prevent infection of the soil, is
 the latest belief of the scientist.</p>

through the root hairs into the roots. What becomes of this water and the
other substances that have been absorbed? This question may be partly
answered by the following experiments.</p>

<p><b>Passage of Fluids up the Stem.</b>&mdash;If any young growing shoots
(young seedlings of corn or pea, or the older stems of garden balsam,
touch-me-not, or sunflower) are placed in red ink (eosin), and left in the
sun for a few hours, the red ink will be found to have passed up the stem.
If such stems were examined <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>carefully, it would be seen that the colored
fluid is confined to collections of woody tubes immediately under the inner
bark. Water evidently rises in that part of the stem we call the wood.</p>

<p><b>Water given off by Evaporation from Leaves.</b>&mdash;Take some

with sheet rubber, fastening the rubber close to the stem of the plant.
Next weigh the plant with the pot. Then cover it with a tall bell jar and
place the apparatus in the sun. In a few minutes drops of moisture are seen
to gather on the <i>inside</i> of the jar. If we now weigh the potted
plant, we find it weighs less than before. Obviously the loss comes from
the water lost, and evidently this water escapes as vapor from either the
stem or leaves.</p>

<p><b>The Structure of a Leaf.</b>&mdash;In the experiment with the red ink
mentioned above we will find that the fluid has gone out into the skeleton
or framework of the leaf. Let us now examine a leaf more carefully. It
shows usually (1) a flat, broad <i>blade</i>, which may take almost any
conceivable shape; (2) a <i>stem</i> which spreads out in the blade (3) in
a number of <i>veins</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Cell Structure of a Leaf.</b>&mdash;The under surface of a leaf
seen under the <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
86]</span>microscope usually shows numbers of tiny oval openings. These are
called <i>stomata</i> (singular <i>stoma</i>). Two cells, usually
kidney-shaped, are found, one on each side of the opening. These are the
<i>guard cells</i>. By change in shape of these cells the opening of the
stoma is made larger or smaller. Larger irregular cells form the
<i>epidermis</i>, or outer covering of the leaf. Study of the leaf in cross
section shows that these stomata open directly into air chambers which
penetrate between and around the loosely arranged cells composing the
underpart of the leaf. The upper surface of leaves sometimes contains
stomata, but more often they are lacking. The under surface of an oak leaf
of ordinary size contains about 2,000,000 stomata. Under the upper
epidermis is a layer of green cells closely packed together (called
collectively the <i>palisade layer</i>). These cells are more or less
columnar in shape. Under these are several rows of rather loosely placed
cells just mentioned. These are called collectively the <i>spongy
tissue</i>. If we happen to have a section cut through a vein, we find this
composed of a number of tubes made up of, and strengthened by, thick-walled
cells. The veins are evidently a continuation of the tubes of the stem out
into the blade of the leaf.</p>

<p><b>Evaporation of Water.</b>&mdash;During the day an enormous amount of
water is taken up by the roots and passed out through the leaves. So great
is this excess at times that a small grass plant on a summer's day
evaporates more than its own weight in water. This would make nearly half a
ton of water delivered to the air during twenty-four hours by a grass plot
twenty-five by one hundred feet, the size of the average city lot.
According to Ward, an oak tree may pass off two hundred and twenty-six
times its own weight in water during the season from June to October.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
87]</span><b>From which Surface of the Leaf is Water Lost?</b>&mdash;In
order to find out whether water is passed out from any particular part of
the leaf, we may remove two leaves of the same size and weight from some
large-leaved plant<a name= "fnanchor_14" id= "fnanchor_14"></a><a href=
"#footnote_14" class= "fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;a mullein was used for the
illustrations given below&mdash;and cover the upper surface of one leaf and
the lower surface of the other with vaseline. The leaf stalks of each
should be covered with wax or vaseline, and the two leaves exactly balanced
on the pans of a balance which has previously been placed in a warm and
sunny place. Within an hour the leaf which has the upper surface covered
with vaseline will show a loss of weight. Examination of the surface of a
mullein leaf shows us that the <i>lower surface of the leaf is provided
with stomata</i>. It is through these organs, then, that water is passed
out from the tissues of the leaf.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Factors in Transpiration.</b>&mdash;The amount of water lost from a
plant varies greatly under different conditions. The humidity of the air,
its temperature, and the temperature of the plant all affect the rate of
transpiration. The stomata also tend to close under some conditions, thus
helping to prevent evaporation. But there seems to be no certain regulation
of this water loss. Consequently plants droop or wilt on hot dry days
because they cannot <a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>obtain water rapidly enough from the soil to
make up for the loss through the leaves.</p>

<p><b>Green Plants Food Makers.</b>&mdash;We have previously stated that
green plants are the great food makers for themselves and for animals. We
are now ready to attack the problem of how green plants <i>make</i>
food.</p>

<p><b>The Sun a Source of Energy.</b>&mdash;We all know the sun is a source
of most of the energy that is released on this earth in the form of heat or
light. Every boy knows the power of a "burning glass." Solar engines have
not come into any great use as yet, because fuel is cheaper, but some day
we undoubtedly will directly harness the energy of the sun in everyday
work. Actual experiments have shown that vast amounts of energy are given
to the earth. When the sun is highest in the sky, energy equivalent to one
hundred horse power is received by a plot of land twenty-five by one
hundred feet, the size of a city lot. Plants receive and use much of this
energy by means of their leaves.</p>

 <p class="caption">Two stages in an experiment to show that green plants
 grow toward the light.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Effect of Light on Plants.</b>&mdash;In young plants which have been
grown in total darkness, no green color is found in either stems or leaves,
the latter often being reduced to mere scales. The stems are long and more
or less reclining. We can explain the changed condition of the seedling
grown in the dark only by assuming that light has some effect on the
protoplasm of the seedling and induces the growth of the green part of the
plant. If seedlings have been growing on a window sill, or where the light
comes in from one side, you have doubtless noticed that the stem and leaves
of the seedlings incline in the direction from which the light comes. <a
name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>The
experiment pictured shows this effect of light very plainly. A hole was cut
in one end of a cigar box and barriers were erected in the interior of the
box so that the seeds planted in the sawdust received their light by an
indirect course. The young seedling in this case responded to the influence
of the stimulus of light so as to grow out finally through the hole in the
box into the open air. This growth of the stem to the light is of very
great importance to a growing plant, because, as we shall see later, food
making depends largely on the amount of sunlight the leaves receive.</p>

 <p class="captionj">The dandelion, showing a whorled arrangement of long
 irregular leaves.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Effect of Light on Leaf Arrangement.</b>&mdash;It is a matter of
common knowledge that green leaves turn toward the light. Place growing pea
seedlings, oxalis, or any other plants of rapid growth near a window which
receives full sunlight. Within a short time the leaves are found to be in
positions to receive the most sunlight possible. Careful observation of any
plant growing outdoors shows us that in almost every case the leaves are so
disposed as to get much sunlight. The ivy climbing up the wall, the
morning-glory, the dandelion, and the burdock all show different
arrangements of leaves, each presenting a large surface to the light.
Leaves are often definitely arranged, fitting in between one <a
name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>another
so as to present their upper surface to the sun. Such an arrangement is
known as a <i>leaf mosaic</i>. In the case of the dandelion, a
<i>rosette</i> or whorled cluster of leaves is found. In the
horse-chestnut, where the leaves come out opposite each other, the older
leaves have longer petioles than the young ones. In the mullein the entire
plant forms a cone. The old leaves near the bottom have long stalks, and
the little ones near the apex come out close to the main stalk. In every
case each leaf receives a large amount of light. Other modifications of
these forms may easily be found on any field trip.</p>

<p><b>Starch made by a Green Leaf.</b>&mdash;If we examine the palisade
layer of the leaf, we find cells which are almost cylindrical in form. In
the protoplasm of such cells are found a number of little green-colored
bodies, which are known as <i>chloroplasts</i> or <i>chlorophyll
bodies</i>. If we place the leaf in wood alcohol, we find that the bodies
still remain, but that the color is extracted, going into the alcohol and
giving to it a beautiful green color. The chloroplasts are, indeed, simply
part of the protoplasm of the cell colored green. These bodies are of the
greatest importance directly to plants and indirectly to animals. <i>The
chloroplasts, by means of the energy received</i> <a name="Page_91"
id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span><i>from the sun,
manufacture starch out of certain raw materials.</i> These raw materials
are soil water, which is passed up through the bundles of tubes into the
veins of the leaf from the roots, and carbon dioxide, which is taken in
through the stomata or pores, which dot the under surface of the leaf. A
plant with variegated leaves, as the coleus, makes starch only in the green
part of the leaf, even though these raw materials reach all parts of the
leaf.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Light and Air necessary for Starch Making.</b>&mdash;If we pin strips
of black cloth, such as alpaca, over some of the leaves of a growing
hydrangea which has previously been placed in a dark room for a few hours,
and then put the plant in direct sunlight for an hour or two, we are ready
to test for starch. We then remove some of the covered leaves and extract
the chlorophyll with wood alcohol (because the green color of the
chlorophyll interferes with the blue color of the starch test). A test then
shows that starch is present only in the portions of the leaves exposed to
sunlight. From this experiment we infer that the sun has something to do
with starch making in a leaf. The necessity of a part of the air (carbon
dioxide) for starch making may also easily be proved, for the <a
name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>parts
of leaves covered with vaseline will be found to contain no starch, while
parts of the leaf without vaseline, but exposed to the sun and air, do
contain starch.</p>

</div>

<p>Air is necessary for the process of starch making in a leaf, not only
because carbon dioxide gas is absorbed (there are from three to four parts
in ten thousand present in the atmosphere), but also because the leaf is
alive and must have oxygen in order to do work. This oxygen it takes from
the air around it.</p>

 <p class="caption">Diagram to illustrate the formation of starch in a

</div>

<p><b>Comparison of Starch Making and Milling.</b>&mdash;The manufacture of
starch by the green leaf is not easily understood. The process has been
compared to the milling of grain. In this case the mill is the green part
of the leaf. The sun furnishes the motive power, the chloroplasts
constitute the machinery, and soil water and carbon dioxide are the raw
products taken into the mill. The manufactured product is starch, and a
certain by-product (corresponding to the waste in a mill) is also given
out. This by-product is oxygen. To <a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>understand the process fully, we must refer
to a small portion of the leaf shown below. Here we find that the cells of
the green layer of the leaf, under the upper epidermis, perform most of the
work. The carbon dioxide is taken in through the stomata and reaches the
green cells by way of the intercellular spaces and by osmosis from cell to
cell. Water reaches the green cells through the veins. It then passes into
the cells by osmosis, and there becomes part of the cell sap. The light of
the sun easily penetrates to the cells of the palisade layer, giving the
energy needed to make the starch. This whole process is a very delicate
one, and will take place only when external conditions are favorable. For
example, too much heat or too little heat stops starch making in the leaf.
This building up of food and the release of oxygen by the plant in the
presence of sunlight is called <i>photosynthesis</i>.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Diagram (after Stevens) to illustrate the processes of
 breathing and food making in the cells of a green leaf in the

</div>

<p><b>Manufacture of Fats.</b>&mdash;Inasmuch as tiny droplets of oil are
found <i>inside</i> the chlorophyll bodies in the leaf, we believe that
fats, too, are made there, probably by a transformation of the starch
already manufactured.</p>

<p><b>Protein Making and its Relation to the Making of Living
Matter.</b>&mdash;Protein material is a food which is necessary to form
protoplasm. <a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
94]</span>Protein food is present in the leaf, and is found in the stem or
root as well. Proteins can apparently be manufactured in any of the cells
of green plants, the presence of light not seeming to be a necessary
factor. How it is manufactured is a matter of conjecture. The minerals
brought up in the soil water form part of its composition, and starch or
grape sugar give three elements (C, H, and O). The element nitrogen is
taken up by the roots as a nitrate (nitrogen in combination with lime or
potash). Proteins are probably not made directly into protoplasm in the
leaf, but are stored by the cells of the plant and used when needed, either
to form new cells in growth or to repair waste. While plants and animals
obtain their food in different ways, they probably make it into living
substance (<i>assimilate</i> it) in exactly the same manner.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px">

 width="250" height="317"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">An example of how a tree may exert energy. This rock
 has been split by the growing tree.</p>
</div>

<p>Foods serve exactly the same purposes in plants and in animals; they
either build living matter or they are burned (oxidized) to furnish energy
(power to do work). If you doubt that a plant exerts energy, note how the
roots of a tree bore their way through the hardest soil, and how stems or
roots of trees often split open the hardest rocks, as illustrated in the
figure above.</p>

<p><b>Starch-Making and its Relation to Human Welfare.</b>&mdash;Leaves
which have been in darkness show starch to be present soon after exposure
to light. A corn plant sends 10 to 15 grams of reserve material into the
ears in a single day. The formation of fruit, and especially the growth of
the grain fields, show the economic importance of this fact. Not only do
plants make their own food and store it away, but they make food for
animals as well. And <a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>the food is stored in such a stable form that
it may be sent to all parts of the world in the form of grain or other
fruits. Animals, herbivorous and flesh-eating, man himself, all are
dependent upon the starch-making processes of the green plant for the
ultimate source of their food. When we remember that in 1913 in the United
States the total value of all farm crops was over $6,000,000,000, and when
we realize that these products came from the air and soil through the
energy of the sun, we may begin to realize why as city boys and girls the
study of plant biology is of importance to us.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Experiment to show that oxygen is given off by green
 plants in the sunlight.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Green Plants give off Oxygen in Sunlight.</b>&mdash;In still another
way green plants are of direct use to us in the city. During this process
of starch-making oxygen is given off as a by-product. This may easily be
proven by the following experiment.<a name= "fnanchor_15" id=
"fnanchor_15"></a><a href= "#footnote_15" class= "fnanchor">[15]</a> Place
any green water plant in a battery jar partly filled with water, cover the
plants with a glass funnel and mount a test tube full of water over the
mouth of the funnel. Then place the apparatus in a warm sunny window.
Bubbles of gas are seen to rise from the plant. After two or three hours of
hot sun, enough of the gas can be obtained by displacement of the water to
make the oxygen test.</p>

<p>That oxygen is given off as a by-product by green plants is a fact of
far-reaching importance. City parks are true "breathing spaces." The green
covering of the earth is giving to animals an element that they must have,
while the animals in their turn are supplying to the plants carbon dioxide,
a compound used in food-making. Thus a widespread relation of mutual
helpfulness exists between plants and animals.</p>

<p><b>Respiration by Leaves.</b>&mdash;<a name="Page_96"
id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>All living things
require oxygen. It is by means of the oxidation of food materials within
the plant's body that the energy used in growth and movement is released. A
plant takes in oxygen largely through the stomata of the leaves, to a less
extent through the <i>lenticels</i> or breathing holes in the stem, and
through the roots. Thus rapidly growing tissues receive the oxygen
necessary for them to perform their work. The products of oxidation in the
form of carbon dioxide are also passed off through these same organs. It
can be shown by experiment that a plant uses up oxygen in the darkness; in
the light the amount of oxygen given off as a by-product in the process of
starch-making is, of course, much greater than the amount used by the
plant.</p>

<p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;From the above paragraphs it is seen that a leaf
performs the following functions: (1) breathing, or the taking in of oxygen
and passing off of carbon dioxide; (2) starch-making, with the incidental
passing out of oxygen; (3) formation of proteins, with their digestion and
assimilation to form new tissues; and (4) the transpiration of water.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_14" id="footnote_14"></a>

 demonstration.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Circulation and Final Uses of Foods in Green
Plants.</b>&mdash;We have seen that cells of green plants make food and
that such cells are mostly in the leaves. But <i>all</i> parts of the
bodies of plants grow. Roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits grow.
Seeds are storehouses of food. We must now examine the stem of some plant
in order to see how food is distributed, stored, and finally used in the
various parts of the plant.</p>

<p><b>The Structure of a Woody Stem.</b>&mdash;If we cut a cross section
through a young willow or apple stem, we find it shows three distinct
regions. The center is occupied by the spongy, soft <i>pith</i>;
surrounding this is found the rather tough <i>wood</i>, while the outermost
area is <i>bark</i>. More careful study of the bark reveals the presence of
three layers&mdash;an outer layer, a middle green layer, and an inner
fibrous layer, the latter usually brown in color. This layer is made up
largely of tough fiberlike cells known as <i>bast</i> fibers. The most
important parts of this inner bark, so far as the plant is concerned, are
many tubelike structures known as <i>sieve tubes</i>. These are long rows
of living cells, having perforated <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>sievelike ends. Through these cells food
materials pass downward from the upper part of the plant, where they are
manufactured.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Section of a twig of box elder three years old, showing
 three annual growth rings. The radiating lines (<i>m</i>) which cross the
 wood (<i>w</i>) represent the pith rays, the principal ones extending from
 the pith in the center to the cortex or bark. (From Coulter's <i>Plant
 Relations</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>In the wood will be noticed (see Figure) a number of lines radiating
outward from the pith toward the bark. These are thin plates of pith which
separate the wood into a number of wedge-shaped masses. These masses of
wood are composed of many elongated cells, which, placed end to end, form
thousands of little tubes connecting the leaves with the roots. In addition
to these are many thick-walled cells, which give strength to the mass of
wood. The bundles of tubes with their surrounding hard walled cells are the
continuation of the bundles of tubes which are found in the root. In
sections of wood which have taken several years to grow, we find so-called
<i>annual rings</i>. The distance between one ring and the next (see
Figure) usually represents the amount of growth in one year. Growth takes
place from an actively dividing layer of cells, known as the <i>cambium
layer</i>. This layer forms wood cells from its inner surface and bark from
its outer surface. Thus new wood is formed as a distinct ring around the
old wood.</p>

<p><b>Use of the Outer Bark.</b>&mdash;The outer bark of a tree is
protective. The cells are dead, the heavy woody skeletons serving to keep
out cold and dryness, as well as prevent the evaporation of fluids from
within. The bark also protects the tree from attack of other plants or
animals which might harm it. Most trees are provided with a layer of corky
cells. This layer in the cork oak is thick enough to be of commercial
importance. The function of the corky layer in preventing evaporation is
well seen in the case of the potato, which is a true stem, though found
underground. If <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>two potatoes of equal weight are balanced on
the scales, the skin having been peeled from one, the peeled potato will be
found to lose weight rapidly. This is due to loss of water, which is held
in by the skin of the unpeeled potato (see right hand figure below).</p>

<p>There are also small breathing holes known as <i>lenticels</i> scattered
through the surface of the bark. These can easily be seen in a young woody
stem of apple, beech, or horse-chestnut.</p>

 width="500" height="290"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Experiment to show that the skin of the potato (a stem)
 retards evaporation.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Proof that Food passes down the Stem.</b>&mdash;If freshly cut willow
twigs are placed in water, roots soon begin to develop from that part of
the stem which is under water. If now the stem is girdled by removing the
bark in a ring just above where the roots are growing, the latter will
eventually die, and new roots will appear above the girdled area. The food
material necessary for the outgrowth of roots evidently comes from above,
and the passage of food materials takes place in a downward direction just
outside the wood in the layer of bark which contains the bast fibers and
sieve tubes. This experiment with the willow explains why it is that trees
die when girdled so as to cut the sieve tubes of the inner bark. The food
supply is cut off from the protoplasm of the cells in the part of the tree
below the cut area. Many of the canoe birches of our Adirondack forest are
thus killed, girdled by thoughtless <a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>visitors. In the
same manner mice and other gnawing animals kill fruit trees. Food
substances are also conducted to a much less extent in the wood itself, and
food passes from the inner bark to the center of the tree by way of the
pith plates. This can be proved by testing for starch in the pith plates of
young stems. It is found that much starch is stored in this part of the
tree trunk.</p>

 width="200" height="361"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Experiment to show that food material passes down in
 the inner bark.</p>
</div>

<p><b>In what Form does Food pass through the Stem?</b>&mdash;We have
already seen that materials in solution (those substances which will
dissolve in the water) will pass from cell to cell by the process of
osmosis. This is shown in the experiment illustrated in the figure. Two
thistle tubes are partly filled, one with starch and water, the other with
sugar and water, and a piece of parchment paper is tied over the end of
each. The lower ends of both tubes are placed in a glass dish under water.
After twenty-four hours, the water in the dish is tested for starch, and
then for sugar. We find that only the sugar, which has been dissolved by
the water, can pass through the membrane.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i104b.jpg"
 width="200" height="213"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj"> Experiment to show osmosis of sugar (right hand tube)
 and non-osmosis of starch (left hand tube).</p>
</div>

<p><b>Digestion.</b>&mdash;Much of the food made in the leaves is stored in
the form of starch. But starch, being insoluble, cannot be passed from cell
to cell in a plant. It must be changed to a soluble form, for otherwise it
could not pass through the delicate cell membranes. This is accomplished by
the process of <i>digestion</i>. We have already seen that starch is
changed to grape sugar in the corn by the action of a substance <a
name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>(an
enzyme) called <i>diastase</i>. This process of digestion seemingly may
take place in all living parts of the plant, although most of it is done in
the leaves. In the bodies of all animals, including man, starchy foods are
changed in a similar manner, but by other enzymes, into soluble grape
sugar.</p>

<p>The food material may be passed in a soluble form until it comes to a
place where food storage is to take place, then it can be transformed to an
insoluble form (starch, for example); later, when needed by the plant in
growth, it may again be transformed and sent in a soluble form through the
stem to the place where it will be used.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, protein seems to be changed and transferred to
various parts of the plant. Some forms of protein substance are
<i>soluble</i> and others <i>insoluble</i> in water. White of egg, for
example, is slightly soluble, but can be rendered insoluble by heating it
so that it coagulates. Insoluble proteins are digested within the plant;
how and where is but slightly understood. In a plant, soluble proteins pass
down the sieve tubes in the bast and then may be stored in the bast or
medullary rays of the wood in an insoluble form, or they may pass into the
fruit or seeds of a plant, and be stored there.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Diagram to show the areas in a plant through which the
 raw food materials pass up the stem and food materials pass down.</p>
</div>

<p><b>What forces Water up the Stem.</b>&mdash;We have seen that the
process of osmosis is responsible for taking in soil water, and that the
enormous absorbing surface exposed by the root hairs makes possible the
absorption of a large amount of water. Frequently this is more than the
weight of the plant in every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Experiments have been made which show that at certain times in the year
this water is in some way forced up the tiny tubes of the stem. During the
spring season, in young and rapidly growing trees, water has been proved to
rise to a height of nearly ninety feet. The force that causes this rise of
water in stems is known as <i>root pressure</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
102]</span> The greatest factor, however, is transpiration of water from
leaves. This evaporation of water in the form of vapor seems to result in a
kind of suction on the column of water in the stem. In the fall, after the
leaves have gone, much less water is taken in by roots, showing that an
intimate relation exists between the leaves and the root.</p>

<p><b>Summary of the Functions of Green Plants.</b>&mdash;The processes
which we have just described (with the exception of food making) are those
which occur in the lives of any plant or animal. All plants and animals
breathe, they oxidize their foods to release energy, carbon dioxide being
given off as the result of the union of the carbon in the foods with the
oxygen of the air. Both plants and animals digest their food; plants may do
this in the cells of the root, stem, and leaf. Digestion must always occur
so that food can be moved in a soluble condition from cell to cell in the
plant's body.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Plants with Special Digestive Organs.</b>&mdash;Some plants have
special organs of digestion. One of these, the sundew, has leaves which are
covered on one side with tiny glandular hairs. These attract insects and
later serve to catch and digest the nitrogenous matter of these insects by
means of enzymes poured out by the same hairs. Another plant, the Venus fly
trap, catches insects in a sensitive leaf which folds up and holds the
insect fast until enzymes poured out by the leaf slowly digest it. Still
others, <a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
103]</span>called pitcher plants, use as food the decayed bodies of insects
which fall into their cuplike leaves and die there. In this respect plants
are like those animals which have certain organs in the body set apart for
the digestion of food.</p>

<p><b>Assimilation.</b>&mdash;The assimilation of foods, or making of foods
into living matter, is a process we know very little about. We know it
takes place in the living cells of plants and animals. But how foods are
changed into living matter is one of the mysteries of life which we have
not yet solved.</p>

<p><b>Excretion.</b>&mdash;The waste and repair of living matter seems to
take place in both plants and animals. When living plants breathe, they
give off carbon dioxide. In the process of starch-making, oxygen might be
considered the waste product. Water is evaporated from leaves and stems.
The leaves fall and carry away waste mineral substances which they
contain.</p>

 (<i>b</i>) the barberry, (<i>c</i>) the potato, (<i>d</i>) the four
 o'clock, showing the position of their food supply. (After Gray.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Reproduction.</b>&mdash;Finally, both plants and animals have organs
of reproduction. We have seen that the flower gives rise, after
pollination, to a fruit which holds the seeds. These seeds hold the
<i>embryo</i>. Thus the young plant is doubly protected for a time and is
finally thrown off in the seed with enough food to give it a start in life.
In much the same way we will find that animals reproduce, either by laying
eggs which contain an <i>embryo</i> and food to start it in life or, as in
the higher animals, by holding and protecting the embryo within the body of
the mother until it is born, a helpless little creature, to be tenderly
nourished by the mother until able to care for itself.</p>

<p><b>The Life Cycle.</b>&mdash;Ultimately both plants and animals grow old
and die. Some plants, for example the pea or bean, live but <a
name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>a
season; others, such as the big trees of California, live for hundreds of
years. Some insects exist as adults but a day, while the elephant is said
to live almost two hundred years. The span of life from the time the plant
or animal begins to grow until it dies is known as the <i>life
cycle</i>.</p>

earth's surface. They prevent soil from being washed away, and they hold
moisture in the ground. The devastation of immense areas in China and
considerable damage by floods in parts of Switzerland, France, and in
Pennsylvania has resulted where the forest covering has been removed. No
one who has tramped through our Adirondack forest can escape noticing the
differences in the condition of streams surrounded by forest and those
which flow through areas from which trees have been cut. The latter streams
often dry up entirely in hot weather, while the forest-shaded stream has a
never failing supply of crystal water.</p>

<p>The city of New York owes much of its importance to its position at the
mouth of a great river with a harbor large enough to float the navies of
the world. This river is supplied with water largely from the Adirondack
and Catskill forests. Should these forests be destroyed, it is not
impossible that the frequent freshets which would follow would so fill the
Hudson River with silt and débris that the ship channels in the bay,
already costing the government hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to
keep dredged, would become too shallow for ships. If <a name="Page_107"
id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>this <i>should</i>
occur, the greatest city in this country would soon lose its place and
become of second-rate importance.</p>

<p>The story of how this very thing happened to the old Greek city of
Poseidonia is graphically told in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">"It was such a strange, tremendous story, that of the
Greek Poseidonia, later the Roman Pæstum. Long ago those adventuring
mariners from Greece had seized the fertile plain, which at that time was
covered with forests of great oak and watered by two clear and shining
rivers. They drove the Italian natives back into the distant hills, for the
white man's burden even then included the taking of all the desirable
things that were being wasted by incompetent natives, and they brought over
colonists&mdash;whom the philosophers and moralists at home maligned, no
doubt, in the same pleasant fashion of our own day. And the colonists cut
down the oaks, and plowed the land, and built cities, and made harbors, and
finally dusted their busy hands and busy souls of the grime of labor and
wrought splendid temples in honor of the benign gods who had given them the
possessions of the Italians and filled them with power and fatness.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Every once in so often the natives looked lustfully
down from the hills upon this fatness, made an armed snatch at it, were
driven back with bloody contumely, and the heaping of riches upon riches
went on. And more and more the oaks were cut down&mdash;mark that! for the
stories of nations are so inextricably bound up with the stories of
trees&mdash;until all the plain was cleared and tilled; and then the
foothills were denuded, and the wave of destruction crept up the mountain
sides, and they, too, were left naked to the sun and the rains.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"At first these rains, sweeping down torrentially,
unhindered by the lost forests, only enriched the plain with the
long-hoarded sweetness of the trees; but by and by the living rivers grew
heavy and thick, vomiting mud into the ever shallowing harbors, and the
land soured with the undrained stagnant water. Commerce turned more and
more to deeper ports, and mosquitoes began to breed in the brackish soil
that was making fast between the city and the sea.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Who of all those powerful landowners and rich
merchants could ever have dreamed that little buzzing insects could sting a
great city to death? But they did. Fevers grew more and more prevalent. The
malaria haunted population went more and more languidly about their
business. The natives, hardy and vigorous in the hills, were but feebly
repulsed. Carthage demanded tribute, and Rome took it, and changed the
city's name from Poseidonia to Pæstum. After Rome grew weak, Saracen <a
name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>
corsairs came in by sea and grasped the slackly defended riches, and the
little winged poisoners of the night struck again and again, until grass
grew in the streets, and the wharves crumbled where they stood. Finally,
the wretched remnant of a great people wandered away into the more
wholesome hills, the marshes rotted in the heat and grew up in coarse reeds
where corn and vine had flourished, and the city melted back into the
wasted earth."<a name= "fnanchor_16" id= "fnanchor_16"></a><a href=

 ruined by erosion. (Carnegie Institution Research in China.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Prevention of Erosion by Covering of Organic Soil.</b>&mdash;We have
shown how ungoverned streams might dig out soil and carry it far from its
original source. Examples of what streams have done may be seen in the
deltas formed at the mouths of great rivers. The forest prevents this by
holding the water supply and letting it out gradually. This it does by
covering the inorganic soil with humus or decayed organic material. In this
way the forest floor <a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>becomes like a sponge, holding water through
long periods of drought. The roots of the trees, too, help hold the soil in
place. The gradual evaporation of water through the stomata of the leaves
cools the atmosphere, and this tends to precipitate the moisture in the
air. Eventually the dead bodies of the trees themselves are added to the
organic covering, and new trees take their place.</p>

 <p class="caption">The forest regions of the United States.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Other Uses of the Forest.</b>&mdash;In some localities forests are
used as windbreaks and to protect mountain towns against avalanches. In
winter they moderate the cold, and in summer reduce the heat and lessen the
danger from storms. Birds nesting in the woods protect many valuable plants
which otherwise might be destroyed by insects.</p>

<p>Forests have great commercial importance. Pyrogallic and other acids are
obtained from trees, as are tar, creosote, resin, turpentine, and many
useful oils. The making of maple sirup and sugar forms a profitable
industry in several states.</p>

<p><b>The Forest Regions of the United States.</b>&mdash;The combined area
of all the forests in the United States, exclusive of Alaska, is about
500,000,000 acres. This seemingly immense area is rapidly decreasing <a
name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>in
acreage and in quality, thanks to the demands of an increasing population,
a woeful ignorance on the part of the owners of the land, and wastefulness
on the part of cutters and users alike.</p>

<p>A glance at the map on page <a href="#Page_109">109</a> shows the
distribution of our principal forests. Washington ranks first in the
production of lumber. Here the great Douglas fir, one of the "evergreens,"
forms the chief source of supply. In the Southern states, especially
Louisiana and Mississippi, yellow pine and cypress are the trees most
lumbered.</p>

 <p class="caption">Transportation of lumber in the East. Logs are mostly

</div>

<p><b>Uses of Wood.</b>&mdash;Even in this day of coal, wood is still by
far the most used fuel. It is useful in building. It outlasts iron under
water, in addition to being durable and light. It is cheap and, with care
of the forests, inexhaustible, while our mineral wealth may some day be
used up. Distilled wood gives wood alcohol. Partially burned wood is
charcoal. In our forests much of the soft wood (the cone-bearing trees,
spruce, balsam, hemlock, and pine), and poplars, aspens, basswood, with
some other species, make paper pulp. The daily newspaper and cheap books
are responsible for inroads on our forests which cannot well be repaired.
It is not necessary to take the largest trees to make pulp wood. Hence many
young trees of not more than six inches in diameter are sacrificed. Of the
hundreds of species of trees in our forests, the conifers are probably most
sought after for lumber. Pine, especially, is probably used more
extensively than any other wood. It is used in all heavy construction work,
frames of houses, bridges, masts, spars and timber of ships, floors,
railway ties, and many other <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>purposes. Cedar is used for shingles,
cabinetwork, lead pencils, etc.; hemlock and spruce for heavy timbers and,
as we have seen, for paper pulp. Another use for our lumber, especially
odds and ends of all kinds, is in the packing-box industry. It is estimated
that nearly 50 per cent of all lumber cut ultimately finds its way into the
construction of boxes. Hemlock bark is used for tanning.</p>

 Dept. of Agriculture.)</p>
</div>

<p>The hard woods&mdash;ash, basswood, beech, birch, cherry, chestnut, elm,
maple, oak, and walnut&mdash;are used largely for the "trim" of our houses,
for manufacture of furniture, wagon or car work, and endless other
purposes.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Methods of cutting Timber.</b>&mdash;A glance at the
diagram of the sections of timber shows us that a tree may be cut radially
through the middle of the trunk or tangentially to the middle portion. Most
lumber is cut tangentially. In wood cut in this manner the yearly rings
take a more or less irregular course. The grain in wood is caused by the
fibers not <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
112]</span> taking straight lines in their course in the tree trunk. In
many cases the fibers of the wood take a spiral course up the trunk, or
they may wave outward to form little projections. Boards cut out of such a
piece of wood will show the effect seen in many of the school desks, where
the annual rings appear to form elliptical markings. Quite a difference in
color and structure is often seen between the heartwood, composed of the
dead walls of cells occupying the central part of the tree trunk, and the
sapwood, the living part of the stem.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Section of a tree trunk showing knot.</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller"><b>Knots.</b>&mdash;Knots, as can be seen from the
diagram, are branches which at one time started in their outward growth and
were for some reason killed. Later, the tree, continuing in its outward
growth, surrounded them and covered them up. A dead limb should be pruned
before such growth occurs. The markings in bird's-eye maple are caused by
buds which have not developed, and have been overgrown with the wood of the
tree.</p>

<p><b>Destruction of the Forest.</b>&mdash;<i>By Waste in
Cutting.</i>&mdash;Man is responsible for the destruction of one of this
nation's most valuable assets. This is primarily due to wrong and wasteful
lumbering. Hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of lumber is left to rot
annually because the lumbermen do not cut the trees close enough to the
ground, or because through careless felling of trees many other smaller
trees are injured. There is great waste in the mills. In fact, man wastes
in every step from the forest to the finished product.</p>

<p><i>By Fire.</i>&mdash;Indirectly, man is responsible for fire, one of
the greatest enemies of the forest. Most of the great forest fires of
recent years, the losses from which total in the hundreds of millions, have
been due either to railroads or to carelessness in making fires in the
woods. It is estimated that in forest lands traversed by railroads from 25
per cent to 90 per cent of the fires are caused by coal-burning
locomotives. For this reason laws have been made in New York State
requiring locomotives passing through the Adirondack forest preserve to
burn oil instead of coal. This has resulted in a considerable reduction in
the number of fires. In addition to the loss in timber, the fires often
burn out the organic <a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>matter in the soil (the "duff") forming the
forest floor, thus preventing the growth of forest there for many years to
come. In New York and other states fires are fought by an organized corps
of fire wardens, whose duty it is to watch the forest and to fight forest
fires.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A forest in the far west totally destroyed by fire and

</div>

<p><b>Other Enemies.</b>&mdash;Other enemies of the forest are numerous
fungus plants, insect parasites which bore into the wood or destroy the
leaves, and grazing animals, particularly sheep. Wind and snow also
annually kill many trees.</p>

<p><b>Forestry.</b>&mdash;In some parts of central Europe, the value of the
forests was seen as early as the year 1300 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,
and many towns consequently bought up the surrounding forests. The city of
Zurich has owned forests in its vicinity for at least 600 years and has
found them a profitable investment. In this country only recently has the
importance of preserving and caring for our forests been noted by our
government. Now, however, we have a Forest Survey of the Department of
Agriculture and numerous state and university schools of forestry which are
rapidly teaching <a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>the people of this country the best methods
for the preservation of our forests. The Federal government has set aside a
number of tracts of mountain forest in some of the Western states, making a
total area of over 167,000,000 acres. New York has established for the same
purpose the Adirondack Park, with nearly 1,500,000 acres of timberland.
Pennsylvania has one of 700,000 acres, and many other states have followed
their example.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A German beech forest. The trees are kept thinned out

</div>

<p><b>Methods for Keeping and Protecting the Forests.</b>&mdash;Forests
should be kept thinned. Too many trees are as bad as too few. They struggle
with one another for foothold and light, which only a few can enjoy. In
cutting the forest, it should be considered as a harvest. The oldest trees
are the "ripe grain," the younger trees being left to grow to maturity.
Several methods of renewing the forest are in use in this country. (1)
Trees may be cut down and young ones allowed to sprout from cut stumps.
This is called coppice growth. This growth is well seen in parts of New
Jersey. (2) Areas or strips may be cut out so that seeds from neighboring
trees are carried there to start new <a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>growth. (3) Forests
may be artificially planted. Two seedlings planted for every tree cut is a
rule followed in Europe. (4) The most economical method is that shown in
the lower picture on page <a href="#Page_114">114</a>, where the largest
trees are thinned out over a large area so as to make room for the younger
ones to grow up. The greatest dangers to the forests are from fire and from
careless cutting, and these dangers may be kept in check by the efficient
work of our national and state foresters.</p>

one of the most beautiful of European capitals, spends over $100,000
annually in caring for and replacing some of the 90,000 trees owned by the
city. All over the United States the city governments are beginning to
realize what European cities have long known, that trees are of great value
to a city. They are now following the example of European cities by
planting trees and by protecting the trees after they are planted.
Thousands of city trees are annually killed by horses which gnaw the bark.
This may be prevented by proper protection of the trunk by means of screens
or wire guards. Chicago has appointed a city forester, who has given the
following excellent reasons why trees should be planted in the
city:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Trees are beautiful in form and color, inspiring a constant
appreciation of nature.</p>

<p>(2) Trees enhance the beauty of architecture.</p>

<p>(3) Trees create sentiment, love of country, state, city, and home.</p>

<p>(4) Trees have an educational influence upon citizens of all ages,
especially children.</p>

<p>(5) Trees encourage outdoor life.</p>

<p>(6) Trees purify the air.</p>

<p>(7) Trees cool the air in summer and radiate warmth in winter.</p>

<p>(8) Trees improve climate and conserve soil and moisture.</p>

<p><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
116]</span> (9) Trees furnish resting places and shelter for birds.</p>

<p>(10) Trees increase the value of real estate.</p>

<p>(11) Trees protect the pavement from the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>(12) Trees counteract adverse conditions of city life.</p>

<p>Let us all try to make Arbor Day what it should be, a day for caring for
and planting trees, for thus we may preserve this most important heritage
of our nation.</p>

<p class="indentref">If a commercial museum is available, a trip should be
planned to work over the topics in this chapter. The school collection may
well include most of the examples mentioned, both of useful and harmful
plants.</p>

<p class="demo">A study of weeds and poisonous plants should be taken up in
actual laboratory work, either by collection and identification or by

<p class="p2"><b>Green Plants have a "Dollar and Cents" Value.</b>&mdash;To
the girl or boy living in the city green plants seem to have little direct
value. Although we see vegetables for sale in stores and we know that
fruits have a money value, we are apt to forget that the wealth of our
nation depends more upon its crops than it does on its manufactories and
business houses. The economic or "dollars and cents" value of plants is
enormous and far too great for us to comprehend in terms of figures.</p>

<p>We have already seen some of the uses to mankind of the products of the
forest; let us now consider some other plant products.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Leaves as Food.</b>&mdash;Grazing animals feed almost entirely on
tender shoots or leaves, blades of grass, and other herbage. Certain leaves
and buds are used by man as food. Lettuce, beet tops, kale, spinach,
broccoli, are examples. A cabbage head is nothing but a big bud which has
been cultivated by <a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>man. An onion is a compact budlike mass of
thickened leaves which contain stored food.</p>

 <p class="caption">Stems used as food.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Stems as Food.</b>&mdash;A city child would, if asked to name some
stem used as food, probably mention asparagus. We sometimes forget that one
of our greatest necessities, cane sugar, comes from the stem of sugar cane.
Over seventy pounds of sugar is used each year by every person in the
United States. To supply the growing demand beets are now being raised for
their sugar in many parts of the world, so that nearly half the total
supply of sugar comes from this source. Maple sugar is a well-known
commodity which is obtained by boiling the sap of sugar maple until it
crystallizes. Over 16,000 tons of maple sugar is obtained every spring,
Vermont producing about 40 per cent of the total output. The sago palm is
another stem <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
119]</span>which supports the life of many natives in Africa. Another stem,
living underground, forms one of man's staple articles of diet. This is the
potato.</p>

<p><b>Roots as Food.</b>&mdash;Roots which store food for plants form
important parts of man's vegetable diet. Beets, radishes, carrots,
parsnips, sweet potatoes, and many others might be mentioned.</p>

 <p class="caption">Seeds and fruits used for food.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Fruits and Seeds as Foods.</b>&mdash;Our cereal crops, corn, wheat,
etc., have played a very great part in the civilization of man and are now
of so much importance to him as food products that bread made from flour
from the wheat has been called the "staff of life." Our grains are the
cultivated progeny of wild grasses. Domestication <a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>of plants and
animals marks epochs in the advance of civilization. The man of the stone
age hunted wild beasts for food, and lived like one of them in a cave or
wherever he happened to be; he was a nomad, a wanderer, with no fixed home.
He may have discovered that wild roots or grains were good to eat; perhaps
he stored some away for future use. Then came the idea of growing things at
home instead of digging or gathering the wild fruits from the forest and
plain. The tribes which first cultivated the soil made a great step in
advance, for they had as a result a fixed place for habitation. The
cultivation of grains and cereals gave them a store of food which could be
used at times when other food was scarce. The word "cereal" (derived from
Ceres, the Roman Goddess of Agriculture) shows the importance of this crop
to Roman civilization. From earliest times the growing of grain and the
progress of civilization have gone hand in hand. As nations have advanced
in power, their dependence upon the cereal crops has been greater and
greater.</p>

<p>"Indian corn," says John Fiske, in <i>The Discovery of America</i>, "has
played a most important part in the history of the New World. It could be
planted without clearing or plowing the soil. There was no need of
threshing or winnowing. Sown in tilled land, it yields more than twice as
much food per acre as any other kind of grain. This was of incalculable
advantage to the English settlers in New England, who would have found it
much harder to gain a secure foothold upon the soil if they had had to
begin by preparing it for wheat or rye."</p>

<p>To-day, in spite of the great wealth which comes from our mineral
resources, live stock, and manufactured products, the surest index of our
country's prosperity is the size of the corn and wheat crop. According to
the last census, the amount of capital invested in agriculture was over
$20,000,000,000, while that invested in manufacture was less than one half
that amount.</p>

<p><b>Corn.</b>&mdash;About three billion bushels of corn were raised in
the United States during the year 1910. This figure is so enormous that it
has but little meaning to us. In the past half century our corn crop has
increased over 350 per cent. Illinois and Iowa are the greatest
corn-producing states, each having a yearly record <a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>of over four hundred
million bushels. The figure on this page shows the principal corn-producing
areas in the United States.</p>

 width="500" height="363"
 alt="Illustration: Indian Corn Production"
 title="States with highest production are Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska,
 Indiana, Kansas, Texas, and Ohio." />
</div>

<p>Indian corn is put to many uses. It is a valuable food. It contains a
large proportion of starch, from which glucose (grape sugar) and alcohol
are made. Machine oil and soap are made from it. The leaves and stalk are
an excellent fodder; they can be made into paper and packing material.
Mattresses can be stuffed with the husks. The pith is used as a protective
belt placed below the water line of our huge battleships. Corn cobs are
used for fuel, one hundred bushels having the fuel value of a ton of
coal.</p>

 title="States with highest production are Minnesota, Kansas, North Dakota,
 Nebraska, Indiana, South Dakota, Washington, Oregon, and Missouri." />
</div>

<p><b>Wheat.</b>&mdash;Wheat is the crop of next greatest importance in
size. Nearly seven hundred millions of bushels were raised in this country
in 1910, representing a total money value of over $700,000,000. Seventy-two
per cent of all the wheat raised comes from the North Central states and
California. About three fourths of the wheat crop is exported, nearly one
half of it to Great Britain, thus indirectly giving employment to thousands
of people on railways and steamships. Wheat has its chief use in its
manufacture <a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
122]</span>into flour. The germ, or young wheat plant, is sifted out during
this process and made into breakfast foods. Flour making forms the chief
industry of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and of several other large and wealthy
cities in this country.</p>

<p><b>Other Grains.</b>&mdash;Of the other grain and cereals raised in this
country, oats are the most important crop, over one billion bushels having
been produced in 1910. Barley is another grain, a staple of some of the
northern countries of Europe and Asia. In this country, it is largely used
in making malt for the manufacture of beer. Rye is the most important
cereal crop of northern Europe, Russia, Germany, and Austro-Hungary
producing over 50 per cent of the world's supply. One of the most important
grain crops for the world (although relatively unimportant in the United
States) is rice. The fruit of this grasslike plant, after thrashing,
screening, and milling, forms the principal food of one third of the human
race. Moreover, its stems furnish straw, its husks make a bran used as food
for cattle, and the grain, when fermented and distilled, yields
alcohol.<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

 <p class="caption">A field of rice, showing the conditions of culture.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Garden Fruits.</b>&mdash;Green plants and especially vegetables have
come to play an important part in the dietary of man. The diseases known as
scurvy and beri-beri, the latter the curse of the far Eastern navies, have
been largely prevented by adding vegetables and fruit juices to the dietary
of the sailors. People in this country are beginning to find that more
vegetables and less meat are better than the meat diet so often used.
Market gardening forms the lucrative business of many thousands of people
near our great cities. Some of the more important fruits are squash,
cucumbers, pumpkins, melons, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, raspberries,
and blackberries. The latter fruits bring in an annual income of
$25,000,000 to our market gardeners. Beans and peas are important as foods
because of their relatively large <a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>amount of protein.
Canning green corn, peas, beans, and tomatoes has become an important
industry.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Picking apples, an important crop in some parts of the
 United States.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Orchard and Other Fruits.</b>&mdash;In the United States over one
hundred and seventy-five million bushels of apples are grown every year.
Pears, plums, apricots, peaches, and nectarines also form large orchards,
especially in California. Nuts form one of our important articles of food,
largely because of the large amount of protein contained in them.</p>

<p>The grape crop of the world is commercially valuable, because of the
raisins and wine produced. The culture of lemons, oranges, and grapefruit
has come in recent years to give a living to many people in this country as
well as in other parts of the world. Figs, olives, and dates are staple
foods in the Mediterranean countries and are sources of wealth to the
people there, as are coconuts, bananas, and many other fruits in tropical
countries.</p>

<p><b>Beverages and Condiments.</b>&mdash;The coffee and cacao beans, and
leaves of the tea plant, products of tropical regions, form the basis of
very important beverages of civilized man. Pepper, black and red, mustard,
allspice, nutmegs, cloves, and vanilla are all products manufactured from
various fruits or seeds of tropical plants.</p>

<p>Alcoholic liquors are produced from various plants in different parts of
the world, the dried fruit of the hop vine being an important product of
New York State used in the making of beer.</p>

<p><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
125]</span><b>Raw Materials.</b>&mdash;Besides use as food, green plants
have many other uses. Many of our city industries would not be in
existence, were it not for certain plant products which furnish the raw
materials for many manufacturing industries. Many cities of the east and
south, for example, depend upon cotton to give employment to thousands of
factory hands.</p>

<p><b>Cotton.</b>&mdash;Of our native plant products cotton is probably of
the most importance to the outside world. Over eleven million bales of five
hundred pounds each are raised annually.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i129.jpg"
 width="500" height="443"
 alt="Illustration: Cotton Crop in United States"
 title="Map shows production in the southern states through central Texas." />
</div>

<p>The cotton plant thrives in warm regions. Its commercial importance is
gained because the seeds of the fruit have long filaments attached to them.
Bunches of these filaments, after treatment, are easily twisted into
threads from which are manufactured cotton cloth, muslin, calico, and
cambric. In addition to the <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>fiber, cottonseed oil, a substitute for
olive oil, is made from the seeds, and the refuse remaining makes an
excellent cattle fodder.</p>

 <p class="captionj"> Map showing the spread of the cotton boll weevil. It
 was introduced from Mexico about 1894. What proportion of the cotton
 raising belt was infected in 1908?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cotton Boll Weevil.</b>&mdash;The cotton crop of the United States
has rather recently been threatened with destruction by a beetle called the
cotton boll weevil. This insect, which bores into the young pod of the
cotton, develops there, stunting the growth of the fruit to such an extent
that seeds are not produced. The loss in Texas alone is estimated at over
$10,000,000 a year. The boll weevil, because of the protection offered by
the cotton boll, is very difficult to exterminate. The weevils are
destroyed by birds, the infected bolls and stalks are burnt, millions are
killed each winter <a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>by cold, other insects prey on them, but at
the present time they are one of the greatest pests the south knows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i131.jpg"
 width="500" height="322"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Mexican cotton boll weevil. Much enlarged, above;
 natural size, below. (Herrick.)</p>
</div>

<p>The control of this pest seems to depend upon early planting so that the
crop has an opportunity to ripen before the insects in the boll grow large
enough to do harm. Ultimately the boll weevil may do more good than harm by
bringing into the market a type of cotton plant that ripens very early.</p>

<p><b>Vegetable Fibers.</b>&mdash;Among the most important are Manila hemp,
which comes from the leaf-stalks of a plant of the banana family and true
hemp, which is the bast or woody fiber of a plant cultivated in most warm
parts of the earth. Flax is also an important fiber plant, grown largely in
Russia and other parts of Europe (see picture on next page). From the bast
fibers of the stem of this herb linen cloth is made.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i132a.jpg"
 width="250" height="434"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Flax grown for fiber.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Vegetable Oils.</b>&mdash;Some of the same plants which give fiber
also produce oil. Cotton seed oil pressed from the seeds, linseed oil from
the seeds of the flax plant, and coconut oil (the covering of the nut here
producing the fiber) are examples.</p>

<p><b>Some Harmful Green Plants.</b>&mdash;We have seen that on the whole
green plants are useful to man. There are, however, some that <a
name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>are
harmful. For example, the poison ivy is extremely poisonous to touch. The
poison ivy is a climbing plant which attaches itself to the trees or walls
by means of tiny air roots which grow out from the stem. It is
distinguished from its harmless climbing neighbor, the Virginia Creeper, by
the fact that its leaves are notched in <i>threes</i> instead of
<i>fives</i>. Every boy and girl should know poison ivy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i132b.jpg"
 width="250" height="406"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Poison ivy, a climbing plant which is poisonous to
 touch. Notice the leaves in threes.</p>
</div>

<p>Numerous other poisonous common plants are found, but one other deserves
special notice because of its presence in vacant city lots. The Jimson Weed
(<i>Datura</i>) is a bushy plant, from two to five feet high, bearing large
leaves. It has white or purplish flowers, and later bears a four-valved
seed pod containing several hundred seeds. These plants contain a powerful
poison, and people are often made seriously ill by eating the roots or
other parts by mistake.</p>

<p><b>Weeds.</b>&mdash;From the economic standpoint the green plants which
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
129]</span>do the greatest damage are weeds. Those plants which provide
best for their young are usually the most successful in life's race. Plants
which combine with the ability to scatter many seeds over a wide territory
the additional characteristics of rapid growth, resistance to dangers of
extreme cold or heat, attacks of enemies, inedibility, and peculiar
adaptations to cross-pollination or self-pollination, are usually spoken of
as weeds. They flourish in the sterile soil of the roadside and in the
fertile soil of the garden. By means of rapid growth they kill other plants
of slower growth by usurping their territory. Slow-growing plants are thus
actually exterminated. Many of our common weeds have been introduced from
other countries and have, through their numerous adaptations, driven out
other plants which stood in their way. Such is the Russian Thistle. A
single plant of this kind will give rise to over 20,000 seeds. First
introduced from Russia in 1873, it spread so rapidly that in twenty years
it had appeared as a common weed over an area of some twenty-five thousand
square miles. It is now one of the greatest pests in our Northwest.</p>

<p><b>The Fungi.</b>&mdash;We have found that green plants on
the whole are useful to mankind. But not all plants are green. Most of us
are familiar with the edible mushroom sold in the markets or <a
name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>the
so-called "toadstools" found in parks or lawns. These plants contain no
chlorophyll and hence do not make their own food. They are members of the
plant group called <i>fungi</i>. Such plants are almost as much dependent
upon the green plants for food as are animals. But the fungi require for
the most part dead organic matter for their food. This may be obtained from
decayed vegetable or animal material in soil, from the bodies of dead
plants and animals, or even from foods prepared for man. Fungi which feed
upon <i>dead</i> organic material are known as <i>saprophytes</i>. Examples
are the mushrooms, the yeasts, molds, and some bacteria, of which more will
be learned later.</p>

 parasite, the chestnut canker.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Some Parasitic Fungi.</b>&mdash;Other fungi (and we will find this
applies to some animals as well) prefer <i>living</i> plants or animals for
their food. Thus a tiny plant, recently introduced into this country, known
as the chestnut canker, is killing our chestnut trees by the thousands in
the eastern part of the United States. It produces millions of tiny
reproductive cells known as <i>spores</i>; these spores, blown about by the
wind, light on the trees, sprout, and send in under the bark a threadlike
structure which sucks in the food circulating in the living cells,
eventually causing the death of the tree. <i>A plant or animal which lives
at the expense of another living plant or animal is called a parasite.</i>
The chestnut canker is a dangerous parasite. Later we shall see that animal
and plant parasites destroy yearly crops and trees valued at hundreds of
millions of dollars and cause untold misery and suffering to humanity.<a

 <p class="caption">Shelf fungi. (Photographed by W. C. Barbour.)</p>
</div>

<p>Another fungus which does much harm to the few trees found in large
towns and cities is the shelf or bracket fungus. The part of the body
visible on the tree looks like a shelf or bracket, hence the name. This
bracket is in reality the reproductive part of the plant; on its lower
surface are formed millions of little bodies called <i>spores</i>. These
spores are capable, under favorable conditions, of reproducing new plants.
The true body of the plant, a network of threads, is found under the bark.
This fungus begins its life as a spore in some part of the tree which has
become <i>diseased</i> or <i>broken</i>. Once established, it spreads
rapidly. There is no remedy except to kill the tree and burn it, so as to
destroy the spores. Many fine trees, sound except for a slight bruise or
other injury, are annually infected and eventually killed. In cities
thousands of trees become infected through careless hitching of horses so
that the horse may gnaw the tree, thus exposing a fresh surface on which
spores may obtain lodgment and grow (see page <a
href="#Page_115">115</a>).</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Suggestions for Field Work.</b>&mdash;A field trip to
a park or grove near home may show the great destruction of timber by this
means. Count the number of perfect trees in a given area. Compare it with
the number of trees attacked by the fungus. Does the fungus appear to be
transmitted from one tree to another near at hand? In how many instances
can you discover the point where the fungus first attacked the tree?</p>

<p><b>Fungi of our Homes.</b>&mdash;But not all fungi are wild. Some have
become introduced into our homes and these live on food or other materials.
<i>These plants are very important because of their relation to life in a
town or crowded city.</i><a name= "fnanchor_17" id= "fnanchor_17"></a><a

 <p class="captionj">Bread mold; <i>r</i>, rhizoids; <i>s</i>, fruiting
 bodies containing spores.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Growth of Bread Mold.</b>&mdash;If a piece of moist bread is
exposed to the air of the schoolroom, or in your own kitchen for a few
minutes and then covered with a glass tumbler and kept in a warm place, in
a day or two a fuzzy whitish growth will appear on the surface of the
bread. This growth shortly turns black. If we now examine a little piece of
the bread with a lens or low-powered microscope, we find a tangled mass of
threads (the <i>mycelium</i>) covering the surface of the bread. From this
mass of threads project tiny upright stalks bearing round black bodies, the
fruit. Little rootlike structures known as <i>rhizoids</i> dip down into
the bread, and absorb food for its threadlike body. The upright threads
with the balls at the end contain many tiny bodies called <i>spores</i>.
These spores have been formed by the division of the protoplasm making up
the fruiting bodies into many separate cells. When grown under favorable
conditions, the spores will produce more mycelia, which in turn bear
fruiting bodies.</p>

<p><b>Physiology of the Growth of Mold.</b>&mdash;Molds, in order to grow
rapidly, need oxygen, moisture, and moderate heat. They seem to prefer
dark, damp places where there is not a free circulation of air, for if the
bell jar is removed from growing mold for even a short time, the mold
wilts. Too great or very little heat will prevent growth and kill
everything except the spores. They obtain their food from the material on
which they live. This they are able to do by means of digestive enzymes
given out by the rootlike parts, by means of which the molds cling to the
bread. These digestive enzymes change the starch of the bread to sugar and
the protein to a soluble form which will pass by osmosis into cells of the
mold. Thus the mold is able to absorb food material. These foods are then
used to supply energy and make protoplasm. This seems to be the usual
method by which saprophytes make use of the materials on which they
live.</p>

<p><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
134]</span><b>What can Molds live On?</b>&mdash;We have seen that black
mold lives upon bread. We would find that it or some other mold
(<i>e.g.</i> green or blue mold) live upon decaying or overripe
fruit,&mdash;apples, peaches, and plums being especially susceptible to
their growth. Molds feed upon all cakes or breads, upon meat, cheese, and
many raw vegetables. They are almost sure to grow upon flour if it is
allowed to get damp. Moisture seems necessary for their growth. Jelly is a
substance particularly favorable to molds for this reason. Shoes, leather,
cloth, paper, or even moist wood will give food enough to support their
growth. At least one troublesome disease, <i>ringworm</i>, is due to the
growth of molds in the skin.</p>

<p><b>What Mold does to Foods.</b>&mdash;Mold usually changes the taste of
the material it grows upon, rendering it "musty" and sometimes unfit to
eat. Eventually it will spoil food completely because decay sets in. Decay,
as we will see later, is not entirely due to mold growth, but is usually
caused by another group of organisms, the <i>bacteria</i>. Molds, however,
in feeding <i>do</i> cause chemical changes which result in decay or
putrefaction. Some molds are useful. They give the flavor to Roquefort,
Gorgonzola, Camembert, and Brie cheeses. But on the whole molds are pests
which the housekeeper wishes to get rid of.</p>

<p><b>How to prevent Molds.</b><a name= "fnanchor_18" id=
"fnanchor_18"></a><a href= "#footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;As we have seen, moisture is favorable for mold
growth; conversely, dryness is unfavorable. Inasmuch as the spores of mold
abound in the air, materials which cannot be kept dry should be covered.
Jelly after it is made should at once be tightly covered with a thin layer
of paraffin, which excludes the air and possible mold spores. Or waxed
paper may be fastened over the surface of the jelly so as to exclude the
spores. To prevent molds from attacking fresh fruit, the surface of the
fruit should be kept dry and, if possible, each piece of fruit should be
wrapped in paper. Why? Heating with dry heat to 212° for a few moments will
kill any mold spores that happen to be in food. Moldy food, if heated after
removing surface on which the mold grew, is perfectly good to eat.</p>

<p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
135]</span> Dry dusting or sweeping will raise dust, which usually contains
mold spores. Use a dampened broom or dust cloth frequently in the kitchen
if you wish to preserve foods from molds.</p>

<p><b>Other Moldlike Fungi.</b>&mdash;Mildews are near relatives of the
molds found in our homes. They may attack leather, cloth, etc., in a damp
house. Other allied forms may do damage to living plants. Some of these
live upon the lilac, rose, or willow. These fungi do not penetrate the host
plant to any depth, for they obtain their food from the outer layer of
cells in the leaf of their host and cover the leaves with the whitish
threads of the mycelium. Hence they may be killed by means of applications
of some fungus-killing fluid, as Bordeaux mixture.<a name= "fnanchor_19"
id= "fnanchor_19"></a><a href= "#footnote_19" class= "fnanchor">[19]</a>
Among the useful plants preyed upon by mildews are the plum, cherry, and
peach trees. (The diseases known as black knot and peach curl are thus
caused.) Another important member of this group is the tiny parasite found
on rye and other grains, which gives us the drug ergot.</p>

<p>Among other parasitic fungi are rusts and smuts. Wheat rust is probably
the most destructive parasitic fungus. Indirectly this parasite is of
considerable importance to the citizen of a great city because of its
effect upon the price of wheat.</p>

<p><b>Fermentation.</b>&mdash;It is of common knowledge to country boys or
girls that the juice of fresh apples, grapes, and some other fruits, if
allowed to stand exposed to the air for a short time will <i>ferment</i>.
That is, the sweet juice will begin to taste sour and to have a peculiar
odor, which we recognize as that of alcohol. The fermenting juice appears
to be full of bubbles which rise to the surface. If we collect enough of
these bubbles of gas to make a test, we find it to be carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Evidently something changed some part of the apple or grape, the sugar,
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), into alcohol,
2(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), and carbon dioxide, 2(CO<sub>2</sub>). This
chemical process is known as <i>fermentation</i>.<a name="Page_136"

</div>

<p><b>Yeast causes Fermentation.</b>&mdash;Let us now take a compressed
yeast cake, shake up a small portion of it in a solution of molasses and
water, and fill a fermentation tube with the mixture. Leave the tube in a
warm place overnight. In the morning a gas will be found to have been
collected in the closed end of the tube (see Figure on page <a
href="#Page_138">138</a>). The taste and odor of the liquid shows alcohol
to be present, and the gas, if tested, is proven carbon dioxide. Evidently
yeast causes fermentation.</p>

<p><b>What are Yeasts?</b>&mdash;If now part of the liquid from the
fermentation tube which contains the settlings be drawn off, a drop placed
on a slide and a little weak iodine added and the mixture examined under
the compound microscope, two kinds of structures will be found (see Figure
below), starch grains which are stained deep blue, and other smaller ovoid
structures of a brownish yellow color. The latter are yeast plants.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i140b.jpg"
 width="250" height="247"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Yeast and starch grains. Notice that the starch grains
 around which are clustered yeast cells have been rounded off by the yeast
 plants. How do you account for this?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Size and Shape, Manner of Growth, etc.</b>&mdash;The common
compressed yeast cake contains millions of these tiny plants. In its
simplest form a yeast plant is a single cell. The shape of such a plant is
ovoid, each cell showing under the microscope the granular appearance of
the protoplasm of which it is formed. Look for tiny clear areas in the
cells; these are vacuoles, or spaces filled with fluid. The nucleus is hard
to find in a yeast cell. Many of the cells seem to have others <a
name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
137]</span>attached to them, sometimes there being several in a row. Yeast
cells reproduce very rapidly by a process of budding, a part of the parent
cell forming one or more smaller daughter cells which eventually become
free from the parent.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Conditions favorable to growth of
Yeast.</b>&mdash;<i>Experiment.</i>&mdash;Label three pint fruit jars A, B,
and C. Add one fourth of a compressed yeast cake to two cups of water
containing two tablespoonfuls of molasses or sugar. Stir the mixture well
and divide it into three equal parts and pour them into the jars. Place
covers on the jars. Put jar A in the ice box on the ice, and jar B over the
kitchen stove or near a radiator; pour the contents of jar C into a small
pan and boil for a few minutes. Pour back into C, cover and place it next
to B. After forty-eight hours, look to see if any bubbles have made their
appearance in any of the jars. If the experiment has been successful, only
jar B will show bubbles. After bubbles have begun to appear at the surface,
the fluid in jar B will be found to have a sour taste and will smell
unpleasantly. The gas which rises to the surface, if collected and tested,
will be found to be carbon dioxide. The contents of jar B have fermented.
Evidently, the growth of yeast will take place only under conditions of
moderate warmth and moisture.</p>

<p><b>Carbohydrates necessary to Fermentation.</b>&mdash;Sugar must be
present in order for fermentation to take place. The wild yeasts cause
fermentation of the apple or grape juice because they live on the skin of
the apple or grape. Various peoples recognize this when they collect the
juice of certain fruits and, exposing it to the air, allow it to ferment.
Such is the <i>saki</i> or rice wine of the Japanese, the <i>tuba</i> or
sap of the coconut palm of the Filipinos and the <i>pulqué</i> of the
Mexicans.</p>

<p><b>Beer and Wine Making.</b>&mdash;Brewers' yeasts are cultivated with
the greatest care; for the different flavors of beer seem to depend largely
upon the condition of the yeast plants. Beer is made in the following
manner. Sprouted barley, called malt, in which the starch of the grain has
been changed to grape sugar by digestion, is killed by drying in a hot
kiln. The malt is dissolved in water, and hops are added to give the
mixture a bitter taste. Now comes the addition of the yeast plants, which
multiply rapidly under the favorable conditions of food and heat.
Fermentation results on a large scale from the breaking down of the grape
sugar, <a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
138]</span>the alcohol remaining in the fluid, and the carbon dioxide
passing off into the air. At the right time the beer is stored either in
bottles or casks, but fermentation slowly continues, forming carbon dioxide
in the bottles. This gives the sparkle to beer when it is poured from the
bottle.</p>

<p>In wine making the wild yeasts growing on the skin of the grapes set up
a slow fermentation. It takes several weeks before the wine is ready to
bottle. In sparkling wines a second fermentation in the bottles gives rise
to carbon dioxide in such quantity as to cause a decided frothing when the
bottle is opened.</p>

<p><b>Commercial Yeast.</b>&mdash;Cultivated yeasts are now supplied in the
home as compressed or dried yeast cakes. In both cases the yeast plants are
mixed with starch and other substances and pressed into a cake. But the
compressed yeast cake must be used fresh, as the yeast plants begin to die
rapidly after two or three days. The dried yeast cake, while it contains a
much smaller number of yeast plants, is nevertheless probably more reliable
if the yeast cannot be obtained fresh.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">
 <img src="images/i142.jpg"
 width="300" height="257"
 alt="Illustration: Experiment with yeast" />
</div>

<p>The cut illustrates an experiment that shows how yeast plants depend
upon food in order to grow. In each of three fermentation tubes were placed
an equal amount of a compressed yeast cake. Then tube <i>a</i> was filled
with distilled water, tube <i>b</i> with a solution of glucose and water,
and tube <i>c</i> with a nutrient solution containing nitrogenous matter as
well as glucose. The quantity of gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) in each tube is an
index of the amount of growth of the yeast cells. In which tube did the
greatest growth take place?</p>

<p><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
139]</span><b>Bread Making.</b>&mdash;Most of us are familiar with the
process of bread making. The materials used are flour, milk or water or
both, salt, a little sugar to hasten the process of fermentation, or
"<i>rising</i>," as it is called, some butter or lard, and yeast.</p>

<p>After mixing the materials thoroughly by a process called "kneading,"
the bread is put aside in a warm place (about 75° Fahrenheit) to "rise." If
we examine the dough at this time, we find it filled with holes, which give
the mass a spongy appearance. The yeast plants, owing to favorable
conditions, have grown rapidly and filled the cavities with carbon dioxide.
Alcohol is present, too, but this is evaporated when the dough is baked.
The baking cooks the starch of the bread, drives off the carbon dioxide and
alcohol, and kills the yeast plants, besides forming a protective crust on
the loaf.</p>

<p><b>Sour Bread.</b>&mdash;If yeast cakes are not fresh, sour bread may
result from their use. In such yeast cakes there are apt to be present
other tiny one-celled plants, known as <i>bacteria</i>. Certain of these
plants form acids after fermentation takes place. The sour taste of the
bread is usually due to this cause. The remedy would be to have fresh
yeast, to have good and fresh flour, and to have clean vessels with which
to work.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Yeasts.</b>&mdash;Yeasts in their relation to man are
thus seen to be for the most part useful. They may get into canned
substances put up in sugar and cause them to "work," giving them a peculiar
flavor. But they can be easily killed by heating to the temperature of
boiling. On the other hand, yeast plants are necessary for the existence of
all the great industries which depend upon fermentation. And best of all
they give us leavened bread, which has become a necessity to most of
mankind.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Bacteria in their Relation to
Man</span></p>

<p><b>What Bacteria do and Where They May be Found.</b>&mdash;A walk
through a crowded city street on any warm day makes one fully alive to
odors which pervade the atmosphere. Some of these unpleasant odors, if
traced, are found to come from garbage pails, from piles of decaying fruit
or vegetables, or from some butcher shop in which decayed meat is allowed
to stand. This characteristic phenomena of decay is one of the numerous
ways in which <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>we can detect the presence of bacteria.
These tiny plants, "man's invisible friends and foes," are to be found
"anywhere, but not everywhere," in nature. They swarm in stale milk, in
impure water, in soil, in the living bodies of plants and animals and in
their dead bodies as well. Most "catching" diseases we know to be caused
directly by them; the processes of decay, souring of milk, acid
fermentation, the manufacture of nitrogen for plants are directly or
indirectly due to their presence. It will be the purpose of the next
paragraphs to find some of the places where bacteria may be found and how
we may know of their presence.</p>

 <p class="caption">A steam sterilizer.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How we catch Bacteria to Study Them.</b>&mdash;To study bacteria it
is first necessary to find some material in which they will grow, then kill
all living matter in this food material by heating to boiling point (212°)
for half an hour or more (this is called <i>sterilization</i>), and finally
protect the <i>culture medium</i>, as this food is called, from other
living things that might grow upon it.</p>

<p>One material in which bacteria seem to thrive is a mixture of beef
extract, digested protein and gelatine or agar-agar, the latter a
preparation derived from seaweed. This mixture, after sterilization, is
poured into flat dishes with loose-fitting covers. These <i>petri</i>
dishes, so called after their inventor, are the traps in which we collect
and study bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Where Bacteria might Grow.</b>&mdash;Expose a number of these
sterilized dishes, each for the same length of time, to some of the
following conditions:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">

<li>(<i>a</i>) exposed to the air of the schoolroom.</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) exposed in the halls of the school while pupils are

moving.</li>

<li><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

<li>(<i>h</i>) dirt from hands placed in dish.</li>

<li>(<i>j</i>) touch surface of dish with decayed vegetable or meat.</li>

<li>(<i>k</i>) touch surface of dish with dirty coin or bill.</li>

<li>(<i>l</i>) place in dish two or three hairs from boy's head.</li>

 <p class="caption">Colonies of bacteria growing in a petri dish.</p>
</div>

<p>Now let us place all of the dishes together in a moderately warm place
(a closet in the schoolroom will do) and watch for results. After a day or
two little spots, brown, yellow, white, or red, will begin to appear. These
spots, which grow larger day by day, are <i>colonies</i> made up of
millions of bacteria. But probably each colony arose from a single
bacterium which got into the dish when it was exposed to the air.</p>

<p><b>How we may isolate Bacteria of Certain Kinds from
Others.</b>&mdash;In order to get a number of bacteria of a given kind to
study, it becomes necessary to grow them in what is known as a pure
culture. This is done by first growing the bacteria in some medium such as
beef broth, gelatin, or on potato.<a name= "fnanchor_20" id=
"fnanchor_20"></a><a href= "#footnote_20" class= "fnanchor">[20]</a> Then
as growth follows the colonies of bacteria appear in the culture media or
the beef broth becomes cloudy. If now we wish to study one given form, it
becomes necessary to isolate them from the others. This is done by the
following process: a platinum needle is first passed through a flame to
<i>sterilize</i> it; that is, to kill all living things that may be on the
needle point. Then the needle, which cools very quickly, is dipped in a
colony containing the bacteria we wish to study. This mass of bacteria is
quickly transferred to another sterilized plate, and this plate is
immediately covered to prevent any other forms of bacteria from entering.
When we have succeeded in isolating a certain kind of bacterium in a given
dish, we are said to have a <i>pure culture</i>. Having obtained a pure
culture of bacteria, they may easily be studied under the compound
microscope.<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">A pure culture of bacteria. Notice that the bacteria
 are all the same size and shape.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Size and Form.</b>&mdash;In size, bacteria are the most minute plants
known. A bacterium of average size is about 1/10000 of an inch in length,
and perhaps 1/50000 of an inch in diameter. Some species are much larger,
others smaller. A common spherical form is 1/50000 of an inch in diameter.
They are so small that several million are often found in a single drop of
impure water or sour milk. Three well-defined forms of bacteria are
recognized: a spherical form called a <i>coccus</i>, a rod-shaped
bacterium, the <i>bacillus</i>, and a spiral form, the <i>spirillum</i>.
Some bacteria are capable of movement when living in a fluid. Such movement
is caused by tiny lashlike threads of protoplasm called <i>flagella</i>.
The flagella project from the body, and by a rapid movement cause
locomotion to take place. Bacteria reproduce with almost incredible
rapidity. It is estimated that a single bacterium, by a process of division
called <i>fission</i>, will give rise to over 16,700,000 others in
twenty-four hours. Under unfavorable conditions they stop dividing and form
rounded bodies called spores. This spore is usually protected by a wall and
may withstand very unfavorable conditions of dryness or heat; even boiling
for several minutes will not kill some forms.</p>

<p><b>Where Bacteria are most Numerous.</b>&mdash;As the result of our
experiments, we can make some generalizations concerning the <a
name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
143]</span>presence of bacteria in our own environment. They are evidently
present in the air, and in greater quantity in air that is moving than
quiet air. Why? That they stick to particles of dust can be proven by
placing a little dust from the schoolroom in a culture dish. Bacteria are
present in greater numbers where crowds of people live and move, the air
from dusty streets of a populous city contains many more bacteria than does
the air of a village street. The air of a city park contains relatively few
bacteria as compared with the near-by street. The air of the woods or high
mountains fewer still. Why? Our previous experiment has shown that dirt on
our hands, the mouth and teeth, decayed meat and vegetables, dirty money,
the very hairs of our head are all carriers of bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Fluids the Favorite Home of Bacteria.</b>&mdash;Tap water, standing
water, milk, vinegar, wine, cider all can be proven to contain bacteria by
experiments similar to those quoted above. Spring or artesian well water
would have very few, if any, bacteria, while the same quantity of river
water, if it held any sewage, might contain untold millions of these little
organisms.<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
144]</span></p>

<p><b>Foods preferred by Bacteria.</b>&mdash;If bacteria are living and
contain no chlorophyll, we should expect them to obtain protein food in
order to grow. Such is not always the case, for some bacteria seem to be
able to build up protein out of simple inorganic nitrogenous substances.
If, however, we take several food substances, some containing much protein
and others not so much, we will find that the bacteria cause decay in the
proteins almost at once, while other food substances are not always
attacked by them.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Growth of bacteria in a drop of impure water allowed to
 run down a sterilized culture in a dish.</p>
</div>

<p><b>What Bacteria do to Foods.</b>&mdash;When bacteria feed upon a
protein they use part of the materials in the food so that it falls to
pieces and eventually rots. The material left behind after the bacteria
have finished their meal is quite different from its original form. It is
broken down by the action of the bacteria into gases, fluids, and some
solids. It has a characteristic "rotten" odor and it has in it poisons
which come as a result of the work of the bacteria. These poisonous wastes,
called <i>ptomaines</i>, we shall learn more about later.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Conditions Favorable and Unfavorable to the Growth of
Bacteria.&mdash;Moisture and
Dryness.</b>&mdash;<i>Experiment.</i>&mdash;Take two beans, remove the
skins, crush one, soak the second bean overnight and then crush it. Place
in test tubes, one dry, the second with water. Leave in a warm place two or
three days, then smell each tube. In which is decay taking place? In which
tube are bacteria at work? How do you know?</p>

<p><b>Moisture.</b>&mdash;Moisture is an absolute need for bacterial
growth, consequently keeping material dry will prevent the growth of germs
upon its surface. Foods, in order to decay, must contain enough water to
make them moist. Bacteria grow most freely in fluids.</p>

<p><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
145]</span> <b>Light.</b>&mdash;If we cover one half of a petri dish in
which bacteria are growing with black paper and then place the dish in a
light warm place for a few days, the growth of bacteria in the light part
of the dish will be found to be checked, while growth continues in the
covered part. It is a matter of common knowledge that disease germs thrive
where dirt and darkness exist and are killed by any long exposure to
sunlight. This shows us the need of light in our homes, especially in our
bedrooms.</p>

<p><b>Air.</b>&mdash;We have seen that plants need oxygen in order to
perform the work that they do. This is equally true of all animals. But not
all bacteria need <i>air</i> to live; in fact, some are killed by the
presence of air. Just how these organisms get the oxygen necessary to
oxidize their food is not well understood. The fact that some bacteria grow
without air makes it necessary for us to use the one sure weapon we have
for their extermination, and that is heat.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Heat.</b>&mdash;<i>Experiment.</i>&mdash;Take four
cultures containing bouillon, inoculate each tube with bacteria and plug
each tube with absorbent cotton. Place one tube in the ice box, a second
tube in a dark closet at a moderate temperature, a third in a warm place
(about 100° Fahrenheit), and boil the contents of the fourth tube for ten
minutes, then place it with tube number two. In which tubes does growth
take place most rapidly? Why?</p>

<p>Bacteria grow very slowly if at all in the temperature of an ice box,
very rapidly at the room temperature of from 70° to 90° and much less
rapidly at a higher temperature. All bacteria except those which have
formed spores can be instantly killed as soon as boiling point is reached,
and most spores are killed by a few minutes boiling.</p>

<p><b>Sterilization.</b>&mdash;The practical lessons drawn from
<i>sterilization</i> are many. We know enough now to boil our drinking
water if we are uncertain of its purity; we sterilize any foods that we
believe might harbor bacteria, and thus keep them from spoiling. The
industry of canning is built upon the principle of sterilization.</p>

<p><b>Canning.</b>&mdash;Canning is simply a method by which first the
bacteria in a substance are killed by heating and then the substance is put
into vessels into which no more bacteria may gain entrance. This is usually
done at home by boiling the fruit <a name="Page_146" id=
"Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>or vegetable to be
canned either in salt and water or with sugar and water, either of which
substances aids in preventing the growth of bacteria. The time of boiling
will be long or short, depending upon the materials to be canned. Some
vegetables, as peas, beans, and corn, are very difficult to can, probably
because of spores of bacteria which may be attached to them. Fruits, on the
other hand, are usually much easier to preserve. After boiling for the
proper time, the food, now free from all bacteria, must be put into jars or
cans that are themselves absolutely <i>sterile</i> or free from germs. This
is done by first boiling the jars, then pouring the boiling hot material
into the hot jars and sealing them so as to prevent the entrance of
bacteria later.</p>

<p><b>Uses of Canning.</b>&mdash;Canning as an industry is of immense
importance to mankind. Not only does it provide him with fruits and
vegetables at times when he could not otherwise get them, but it also
cheapens the cost of such things. It prevents the waste of nature's
products at a time when she is most lavish with them, enabling man to store
them and utilize them later. Canning has completely changed the life of the
sailor and the soldier, who in former times used to suffer from various
diseases caused by lack of a proper balance of food.</p>

 <p class="caption">Pasteurizing milk. Why should this be done?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Pasteurization.</b>&mdash;Milk is one of the most important food
supplies of a great city. It is also one of the most difficult supplies to
get in good condition. This is in part due to the fact that milk is
produced at long distances from the city and must be brought first from
farms to the railroads, then shipped by train, again taken to the milk
supply depot by wagon, there bottled, and again shipped <a name="Page_147"
id="Page_147"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>by delivery wagons
to the consumers. When we remember that much of the milk used in New York
City is forty-eight hours old and when we realize that bacteria grow
<i>very</i> rapidly in milk, we see the need of finding some way to protect
the supply so as to make it safe, particularly for babies and young
children.</p>

<p>This is done by <i>pasteurization</i>, a method named after the French
bacteriologist Louis Pasteur. To pasteurize milk we heat it to a
temperature of not over 170° Fahrenheit for from ten minutes to half an
hour. By such a process all harmful germs will be killed and the keeping
qualities of the milk greatly lengthened. Most large milk companies
pasteurize their city supply by a rapid pasteurization at a much higher
temperature, but this method slightly changes the flavor of the milk.</p>

<p><b>Cold Storage.</b>&mdash;Man has also come to use cold to keep
bacteria from growing in foods. The ice box at home and cold storage on a
larger scale enables one to keep foods for a more or less lengthy period.
If food is frozen, as in cold storage, it might keep without growth of
bacteria for years. But fruits and vegetables cannot be frozen without
spoiling their flavor. And all foods after freezing seem particularly
susceptible to the bacteria of decay. For that reason products taken from
cold storage must be used at once.</p>

<p><b>Ptomaines.</b>&mdash;Many foods get their flavor from the growth of
molds or bacteria in them. Cheese, butter, the gamey taste of certain
meats, the flavor of sauerkraut, are all due to the work of bacteria. But
if bacteria are allowed to grow so as to become very numerous, the
ptomaines which result from their growth in foods may poison the person
eating such foods. Frequently ptomaine poisoning occurs in the summer time
because of the rapid growth of bacteria. Much of the indigestion and
diarrh&oelig;a which attack people during the summer is doubtless due to
this kind of poisoning.</p>

<p><b>Preservatives.</b><a name= "fnanchor_21" id= "fnanchor_21"></a><a
href= "#footnote_21" class= "fnanchor">[21]</a>&mdash;This leads us to ask
if we may not preserve food in ways other than those mentioned so as to
protect ourselves from danger of ptomaine poisoning. Many substances check
the development of bacteria and in this way they <i>preserve</i> <a
name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>the
food. Preservatives are of two kinds, those harmless to man and those that
are poisonous. Of the former, salt and sugar are examples; of the latter,
formaldehyde and possibly benzoic acid.</p>

<p><b>Sugar.</b>&mdash;We have noted the use of sugar in canning. Small
amounts of sugar will be readily attacked by yeasts, molds, and bacteria,
but a 40 to 50 per cent solution will effectually keep out bacteria.
Preserves are fruits boiled in about their own weight of sugar. Condensed
milk is preserved by the sugar added to it; so are candied and, in part,
dried fruits.</p>

<p><b>Salt.</b>&mdash;Salt has been used for centuries to keep foods. Meats
are smoked, dried, and salted; some are put down in strong salt solutions.
Fish, especially cod and herring, are dried and salted. The keeping of
butter is also due to the salt mixed with it. Vinegar is another
preservative. It, like salt, changes the flavor of materials kept in it and
so cannot come into wide use. Spices are also used as preservatives.</p>

<p><b>Harmful Preservatives.</b>&mdash;Certain chemicals and drugs, used as
preservatives, seem to be on the border line of harmfulness. Such are
benzoic acid, borax, or boracic acid. Such drugs <i>may</i> be harmless in
small quantities, but unfortunately in canned goods we do not always know
the amount used. The national government in 1906 passed what is known as
the Pure Food Law, which makes it illegal to use any of these preservatives
(excepting benzoic acid in very small amounts). Food which contains this
preservative will be so labeled and should not be given to children or
people with weak digestion. Unfortunately people do not always read the
labels and thus the pure food law is ineffective in its working.
Infrequently formaldehyde or other preservatives are used in milk. Such
treatment renders milk unfit for ordinary use and is an illegal
process.</p>

<p><b>Disinfectants.</b><a name= "fnanchor_22" id= "fnanchor_22"></a><a
href= "#footnote_22" class= "fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;Frequently it becomes
necessary to destroy bacteria which cause diseases of various kinds. This
process is called <i>disinfecting</i>. The substances commonly used are
carbolic acid, formalin or formaldehyde, lysol, and bichloride of mercury.
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
149]</span>Of these, the last named is the most powerful as well as the
most dangerous to use. As it attacks metal, it should not be used in a
metal pail or dish. It is commonly put up in tablets which are mixed to
form a 1 to 1000 solution. Such tablets should be carefully safeguarded
because of possible accidental poisoning.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde used in liquid form is an excellent disinfectant. When
burned in a formalin candle, it sets free an intensely pungent gas which is
often used for disinfecting sick rooms after the patient has been
removed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px">
 <img src="images/i153.jpg"
 width="300" height="357"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj"> This shows how organic matter is broken down
by bacteria so it may be used again by green
plants.</p>
</div>

<p>Carbolic acid is perhaps the best disinfectant of all. If used in a
solution of about 1 part to 25 of water, it will not burn the skin. It is
of particular value to disinfect skin wounds, as it heals as well as
cleanses when used in a weak solution. Its rather pleasant odor makes it
useful to cover up unpleasant smells of the sick room.</p>

<p>The fumes of burning sulphur, which are so often used for disinfecting,
are of little real value.</p>

<p><b>Bacteria cause Decay.</b>&mdash;Let us next see in what ways the
bacteria directly influence man upon the earth. Have you ever stopped to
consider what life would be like on the earth if things did not decay? The
sea would soon be filled and the land covered with dead bodies of plants
and animals. Conditions of life would become impossible and living things
on the earth would cease to exist.</p>

<p>Fortunately, bacteria cause decay. All organic matter, in <a
name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
150]</span>whatever form, is sooner or later decomposed by the action of
untold millions of bacteria which live in the air, water, and soil. These
soil bacteria are most numerous in rich damp soils containing large amounts
of organic material. They are very numerous around and in the dead bodies
of plants and animals. To a considerable degree, then, these bacteria are
useful in feeding upon these dead bodies, which otherwise would soon cover
the surface of the earth to the exclusion of everything else. Bacteria may
thus be scavengers. They oxidize organic materials, changing them to
compounds that can be absorbed by plants and used in building protoplasm.
Without bacteria and fungi it would be impossible for life to exist on the
earth, for green plants would be unable to get the raw food materials in
forms that could be used in making food and living matter. In this respect
bacteria are of the greatest service to mankind.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Microscopic appearance of ordinary milk, showing fat
 globules and bacteria which cause the souring of milk.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Relation to Fermentation.</b>&mdash;They may incidentally, as a
result of this process of decay, continue the process of fermentation begun
by the yeasts. In making vinegar the yeasts first make alcohol (see page <a
href="#Page_135">135</a>) which the bacteria change to acetic acid. The
lactic acid bacteria, which sour milk, changing the milk sugar to an acid,
grow very rapidly in a warm temperature; hence milk which is cooled
immediately and kept cool or which is pasteurized and kept in a cool place
will not sour readily. Why? These same lactic acid bacteria may be useful
when they sour the milk for the cheese maker.</p>

<p><b>Other Useful Bacteria.</b>&mdash;Certain bacteria give flavor to
cheese and butter, while still other bacteria aid in the "curing" of
tobacco, in the production of the dye indigo, in the preparation of certain
fibers of plants for the market, as hemp, flax, etc., in the <a
name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

the process of tanning hides to make leather.</p>

 <p class="caption">A field of alfalfa, a plant which harbors the
 nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Nitrogen-fixing Bacteria.</b>&mdash;Still other bacteria, as we have
seen before, "change over" nitrogen in organic material in the soil and
even the free nitrogen of the air so that it can be used by plants in the
form of a compound of nitrogen. The bacteria living in tubercles on the
roots of clover, beans, peas, etc., have the power of thus "fixing" the
free nitrogen in the air found between particles of soil. This fact is made
use of by farmers who rotate their crops, growing first a crop of clover or
other plants having root tubercles, which produce the bacteria, then
plowing these in and planting another crop, as wheat or corn, on the same
area. The latter plants, making use of the nitrogen compounds there,
produce a larger crop than when grown in ground containing less nitrogenous
material.</p>

<p><b>Bacteria cause Disease.</b>&mdash;The most harmful bacteria are those
which cause diseases of plants and animals. Certain diseases of
plants&mdash;blights, rots, and wilts&mdash;are of bacterial nature. These
do much annual damage to fruits and other parts of growing plants useful to
man as food. But by far the most important are the bacteria which cause
disease in man. They accomplish this by becoming parasites in the human
body. Millions upon millions of bacteria exist in the human body at all
times&mdash;in the mouth, on the teeth, in the blood, and especially in the
lower <a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
152]</span>part of the food tube. Some in the food tube are believed to be
useful, some harmless, and some harmful; others in the mouth cause decay of
the teeth, while a few kinds, if present in the body, may cause
disease.</p>

<p>It is known that bacteria, like other living things, feed and give off
organic waste from <i>their own</i> bodies. This waste, called a
<i>toxin</i>, is poison to the host on which the bacteria live, and it is
usually the production of this toxin that causes the symptoms of disease.
Some forms, however, break down tissues and plug up the small blood
vessels, thus causing disease.</p>

<p><b>Diseases caused by Bacteria.</b>&mdash;It is estimated that bacteria
cause annually over 50 per cent of the deaths of the human race. As we will
later see, a very large proportion of these diseases might be prevented if
people were educated sufficiently to take the proper precautions to prevent
their spread. These precautions might save the lives of some 3,000,000 of
people yearly in Europe and America. Tuberculosis, typhoid fever,
diphtheria, pneumonia, blood poisoning, syphilis, and a score of other germ
diseases ought not to exist. A good deal more than half of the present
misery of this world might be prevented and this earth made cleaner and
better by the coöperation of the young people now growing up to be our
future home makers.</p>

<p><b>How we take Germ Diseases.</b>&mdash;Germ or contagious diseases
either enter the body by way of the mouth, nose, or other body <a
name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
153]</span>openings, or through a break in the skin. They may be carried by
means of air, food, or water, but are usually <i>transmitted directly</i>
from the person who has the disease to a well person. This may be done
through personal contact or by handling articles used by the sick person or
by drinking or eating foods which have received some of the germs. From
this it follows that if we know the methods by which a given disease is
communicated, we may protect ourselves from it and aid the civic
authorities in preventing its spread.</p>

<p><b>Tuberculosis.</b>&mdash;The one disease responsible for the greatest
number of deaths&mdash;perhaps one seventh of the total on the
globe&mdash;is tuberculosis. It is estimated that of all people alive in
the United States to-day, 5,000,000 will die of this disease. But this
disease is slowly but surely being overcome. It is believed that within
perhaps one hundred years, with the aid of good laws and sanitary living,
it will be almost extinct.<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span

 <p class="caption">This curve shows a decreasing death rate from
 tuberculosis. Explain.</p>
</div>

<p>Tuberculosis is caused by the growth of bacteria, called the <i>tubercle
bacilli</i>, within the lungs or other tissues of the human body. Here they
form little tubers full of germs, which close up the delicate air passages
in the lungs, while in other tissues they give rise to hip-joint disease,
scrofula, lupus, and other diseases, depending on the part of the body they
attack. Tuberculosis may be contracted by taking the bacteria into the
throat or lungs or possibly by eating meat or drinking milk from tubercular
cattle. Especially is it communicated from a consumptive to a well person
by kissing, by drinking or eating from the same cup or plate, using the
same towels, or in coming in direct contact with the person having the
germs in his body. Although there are always some of the germs in the air
of an ordinary city street, and though we may take some of these germs into
our bodies at any time, yet the bacteria seem able to gain a foothold only
under certain conditions. It is only when the tissues are in a worn-out
condition, when we are "run down," as we say, that the parasite may obtain
a foothold in the lungs. Even if the disease gets a foothold, it is quite
possible to cure it if it is taken in time. The germ of tuberculosis is
killed by exposure to bright sunlight and fresh air. Thus the course of the
disease may be arrested, and a permanent cure brought about, by a life in
the open air, the patient sleeping out of doors, taking <a name="Page_155"
id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>plenty of nourishing
food and very little exercise. See also <a href="#Page_373">Chapter

 might get into the water supply: <i>lm</i>, layer of rock; <i>w</i>, wash

</div>

<p><b>Typhoid Fever.</b>&mdash;One of the most common germ diseases in this
country and Europe is typhoid fever. This is a disease which is conveyed by
means of water and food, especially milk, oysters, and uncooked vegetables.
Typhoid fever germs live in the intestine and from there get into the blood
and are carried to all parts of the body. A poison which they give off
causes the fever so characteristic of the disease. The germs multiply very
rapidly in the intestine and are passed off from the body with the excreta
from the food tube. If these germs get into the water supply of a town, an
epidemic of typhoid will result. Among the recent epidemics caused by the
use of water containing typhoid germs have been those in Butler, Pa., where
1364 persons were made ill; Ithaca, N. Y., with 1350 cases; and Watertown,
N. Y., where over 5000 cases occurred. Another source of infection is milk.
Frequently epidemics have occurred which were confined to users of milk
from a certain dairy. Upon investigation it was found that a case of
typhoid had occurred on the farm where the milk came from, that the germs
had washed into the well, and that this water was used to wash the milk
cans. Once in the milk, the bacteria multiplied rapidly, so that the
milkman gave out cultures of <a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>typhoid in his milk bottles. Proper
safeguarding of our water and milk supply is necessary if we are to keep
typhoid away.</p>

<p><b>Blood Poisoning.</b>&mdash;The bacterium causing blood poisoning is
another toxin-forming germ. It lives in dust and dirt and is often found on
the skin. It enters the body through cuts or bruises. It seems to thrive
best in less oxygen than is found in the air. It is therefore important not
to close up with court-plaster wounds which such germs may have entered.
It, with typhoid, is responsible for four times as many deaths as bullets
and shells in time of battle. The wonderfully small death rate of the
Japanese army in their war with Russia was due to the fact that the
Japanese soldiers always boiled their drinking water before using it, and
their surgeons always dressed all wounds on the battlefield, using powerful
antiseptics in order to kill any bacteria that might have lodged in the
exposed wounds.</p>

 would you explain this?</p>

<p><b>Other Diseases.</b>&mdash;Many other diseases have been traced to
bacteria. Diphtheria is one of the best known. As it is a throat disease,
it may easily be conveyed from one person to another by kissing, putting
into the mouth objects which have come in contact with the mouth of the
patient, or by food into which the germs have been carried. Another disease
which probably causes more misery in the world than any other germ disease
is syphilis. Hundreds of thousands of new-born babies die annually or grow
up handicapped by deformities from this dread scourge. Syphilis and
gonorrhea, both diseases of the same sort and contracted in the same
manner, hand down to innocent wives and still more innocent children a
heritage of <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
157]</span>disease "even unto the third and fourth generation." Grippe,
pneumonia, whooping cough, and colds are believed to be caused by bacteria.
Other diseases, as malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, and probably
smallpox, scarlet fever, and measles, are due to the attack of one-celled
animal parasites. Of these we shall learn later in Chapter XV.</p>

<p><b>Immunity.</b>&mdash;It has been found that after an attack of a germ
disease the body will not soon be again attacked by the same disease. This
immunity, of which we will learn more later, seems to be due to a
manufacture in the blood of substances which fight the bacteria or their
poisons. If a person keeps his body in good physical condition and lives
carefully, he will do much toward acquiring this natural immunity.</p>

<p><b>Acquired Immunity.</b>&mdash;Modern medicine has discovered means of
protecting the body from some contagious diseases. Vaccination as
protection against smallpox, the use of antitoxins (of which more later)
against diphtheria, and inoculation against typhoid are all ways in which
we may be protected against diseases.</p>

<p><b>Methods of fighting Germ Diseases.</b>&mdash;As we have seen,
diseases produced by bacteria may be caused by the bacteria being
<i>directly</i> transferred from one person to another, or the disease may
obtain a foothold in the body from food, water, or by taking them into the
blood through a cut or a wound or a body opening.</p>

<p>It is evident that as individuals we may each do something to prevent
the spread of germ diseases, especially in our homes. We may keep our
bodies, especially our hands and faces, clean. Sweeping and dusting may be
done with damp cloths so as not to raise a dust; our milk and water, when
from a suspicious supply, may be <i>sterilized</i> or pasteurized. Wounds
through which bacteria might obtain foothold in the body should be washed
with some <i>antiseptic</i> such as carbolic acid (1 part to 25 water),
which kills the germs. In a later chapter we shall learn more of how we may
coöperate with the authorities to combat disease and make our city or town
a better place in which to live.<a name= "fnanchor_23" id=

<h3>XII. THE RELATIONS OF PLANTS TO ANIMALS</h3>

<p class="demo">Tabular comparison between balanced aquarium and hay

<p class="p2"><b>Some Ways in which Plants affect Animals.</b>&mdash;We
have been studying the life of plants in order better to understand the
life of animals and men. We have seen first that green plants play
indirectly a tremendous part in man's welfare by supplying him with food.
We have found that the colorless plants directly affected his welfare by
causing disease, and by causing decay, thus making usable the nitrogen
locked up in dead bodies of plants and animals, and by some even supplying
nitrogen from the atmosphere. The dependence of animals upon plants has
been shown and the interdependence of plants on animals has also been seen
in cross-pollination and in the supply of raw food materials to plants by
animals.</p>

<p><b>Study of a Balanced Aquarium.</b>&mdash;Perhaps the best way for us
to understand the interrelation between plants and animals is to study an
aquarium in which plants and animals live and in which a balance has been
established between the plant life on one side and animal life on the
other. Aquaria containing green pond weeds, either floating or rooted, a
few snails, some tiny animals known as water fleas, and a fish or two will,
if kept near a light window, show this relation.<a name="Page_160"
id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span></p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">A balanced aquarium. Explain the term "balanced."</p>
</div>

<p>We have seen that green plants under favorable conditions of sunlight,
heat, moisture, and with a supply of raw food materials, give off oxygen as
a by-product while manufacturing food in their green cells. We know the
necessary raw materials for starch manufacture are carbon dioxide and
water, while nitrogenous material is necessary for the making of proteins
within the plant. In previous experiments we have proved that carbon
dioxide is given off by any living thing when oxidation occurs in the body.
The crawling snails and the swimming fish give off carbon dioxide, which is
dissolved in the water; the plants themselves, at all times, oxidize food
within their bodies, and so must <i>pass off</i> some carbon dioxide. The
green plants in the daytime <i>use up</i> the carbon dioxide obtained from
the various sources and, with the water <a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>taken in,
manufacture starch. While this process is going on, oxygen is given off to
the water of the aquarium, and this free oxygen is used by the animals
there.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">This diagram shows that plants and animals on the
 earth hold the same relation to each other as plants and animals in a
 balanced aquarium. Explain the diagram in your notebook.</p>
</div>

<p>But the plants are continually growing larger. The snails and fish, too,
eat parts of the plants. Thus the plant life gives food to the animals
within the aquarium. The animals give off certain nitrogenous wastes of
which we shall learn more later. These materials, with other nitrogenous
matter from the dead parts of the plants or animals, form part of the raw
material used for protein manufacture in the plant. This nitrogenous matter
is prepared for use by several different kinds of bacteria which first
break the dead bodies down and then give it to the plants in the form of
soluble nitrates. The green plants manufacture food, the animals eat the
plants and give off organic waste, from which the plants in turn make their
food and living matter. The plants give off oxygen to the animals, and the
animals give carbon dioxide to the plants. Thus a balance exists between
the plants and animals in the aquarium. Make a table to show this
balance.</p>

 <p class="caption">The relations between green plants and animals.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Relations between Green Plants and Animals.</b>&mdash;What goes on in
the aquarium is an example of the relation existing between all green
plants and all animals. Everywhere in the world green plants are making
food which becomes, sooner or later, the food of animals. Man does not feed
to a great extent upon leaves, but he eats roots, stems, fruits, and seeds.
When he does not feed <a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>directly upon plants, he eats the flesh of
plant eating animals, which in turn feed directly upon plants. And so it is
the world over; the plants are the food makers and supply the animals.
Green plants also give a very considerable amount of oxygen to the
atmosphere every day, which the animals may use.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">
 <img src="images/i166b.jpg"
 width="300" height="199"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">The nitrogen cycle. Trace the nitrogen from its source
 in the air until it gets back again into the air.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Nitrogen Cycle.</b>&mdash;The animals in their turn supply much
of the carbon dioxide that the plant uses in starch making. They also
supply some of the nitrogenous matter used by the plants, part being given
the plants from the dead bodies of their own relatives and part being
prepared from the nitrogen of the air through the agency of bacteria, which
live upon the roots of certain plants. These bacteria are the only
organisms that can take nitrogen from the air. Thus, in spite of all the
nitrogen of the atmosphere, plants and animals are limited in the amount
available. And the <a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>available supply is used over and over
again, perhaps in nitrogenous food by an animal, then it may be given off
as organic waste, get into the soil, and be taken up by a plant through the
roots. Eventually the nitrogen forms part of the food supply in the body of
the plant, and then may become part of its living matter. When the plant
dies, the nitrogen is returned to the soil. Thus the usable nitrogen is
kept in circulation.<a name= "fnanchor_24" id= "fnanchor_24"></a><a href=
"#footnote_24" class= "fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><b>Symbiosis.</b>&mdash;We have seen that in the balanced aquarium the
animals and plants, in a wide sense, form a sort of unconscious
partnership. <i>This process of living together for mutual advantage is
called symbiosis.</i> Some animals thus combine with plants; for example,
the tiny animal known as the hydra with certain of the one-celled algæ,
and, if we accept the term in a wide sense, all green plants and animals
live in this relation of mutual give and take. Animals also frequently live
in this relation to each other, as the crab, which lives within the shell
of the oyster; the sea anemones, which are carried around on the backs of
some hermit crabs, aiding the crab in protecting it from its enemies, and
being carried about by the crab to places where food is plentiful.</p>

 Teitz.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>A Hay Infusion.</b>&mdash;Still another example of the close relation
between plants and animals may be seen in the study of a hay infusion. If
we place a wisp of hay or straw in a small glass jar nearly full of water,
and leave it for a few days in a warm room, certain changes are seen to
take place in the contents of the jar; after a little while the water gets
cloudy and darker in color, and a scum appears on the surface. If some of
this scum is examined under the compound microscope, it will be found to
consist almost entirely of bacteria. These bacteria evidently aid in the
decay which (as the unpleasant odor from the jar testifies) is beginning to
take place. As we have learned, bacteria flourish wherever the food supply
is abundant. The water within the jar has come to contain much of the food
material which was once within the leaves of the grass,&mdash;organic
nutrients, starch, sugar, and proteins, formed in the leaf by the action of
the sun on the chlorophyll <a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>of the leaf, and now released into the water
by the breaking down of the walls of the cells of the leaves. The bacteria
themselves release this food from the hay by causing it to decay. After a
few days small one-celled animals appear; these multiply with wonderful
rapidity, so that in some cases the surface of the water seems to be almost
white with active one-celled forms of life. If we ask ourselves where these
animals come from, we are forced to the conclusion that they must have been
in the water, in the air, or on the hay. Hay is dried grass and may have
been cut in a field near a pool containing these creatures. When the pool
dried up, the wind may have scattered some of these little organisms in the
dried mud or dust. Some may have existed in a dormant state on the hay and
the water awakened them to active <a name="Page_165"
id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>life. In the water,
too, there may have been some living cells, plants and animals.</p>

<p>At first the multiplication of the tiny animals within the hay infusion
is extremely rapid; there is food in abundance and near at hand. After a
few days more, however, several kinds of one-celled animals may appear,
some of which prey upon others. Consequently a struggle for life takes
place, which becomes more and more intense as the food from the hay is used
up. Eventually the end comes for all the animals unless some green plants
obtain a foothold within the jar. If such a thing happens, food will be
manufactured within their bodies, a new food supply arises for the animals
within the jar, and a balance of life may result.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Pleurococcus. A very simple plant cell.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2"><b>The Simplest Plants.</b>&mdash;We have seen that perhaps
the simplest plant would be exemplified by one of the tiny bacteria we have
just read about. A typical one-celled plant, however, would contain green
coloring matter or chlorophyll, and would have the power to manufacture its
own food under conditions giving it a moderate temperature, a supply of
water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and sunlight. Such a simple plant is the
<i>pleurococcus</i>, the "green slime" seen on the shady sides of trees,
stones, or city houses. This plant would meet one definition of a cell, as
it is a minute mass of protoplasm containing a nucleus. It is surrounded by
a wall of a woody material formed by the activity of the living matter
within the cell. It also contains a little mass of protoplasm colored
green. Of the work of the chlorophyll in the manufacture of organic food we
have <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
167]</span>already learned. Such is a simple plant cell. Let us now examine
a simple animal cell in order to compare it with that of a plant.</p>

<p><b>Where to find Param&oelig;cium.</b>&mdash;If we examine very
carefully the surface of a hay infusion, we are likely to notice in
addition to the scum formed of bacteria, a mass of whitish tiny dots
collected along the edge of the jar close to the surface of the water. More
attentive observation shows us that these objects move, and that they are
never found far from the surface.</p>

<p><b>The Life Habits of Param&oelig;cium.</b>&mdash;If we place on a slide
a drop of water containing some of these moving objects and examine it
under the compound microscope, we find each minute whitish dot is a cell,
elongated, oval, or elliptical in outline and somewhat flattened. This is a
one-celled animal known as the <i>param&oelig;cium</i> or the slipper
animalcule (because of its shape).</p>

<p>Seen under the low power of the microscope, it appears to be extremely
active, rushing about now rapidly, now more slowly, but seemingly always
taking a definite course. The narrower end of the body (the
<i>anterior</i>) usually goes first. If it pushes its way past any dense
substance in the water, the cell body is seen to change its shape
temporarily as it squeezes through.</p>

<p><b>Response to Stimuli.</b>&mdash;Many of these little creatures may be
found collected around masses of food, showing that they are attracted by
it. In another part of the slide we may find a number of the
param&oelig;cia lying close to the edge of an air bubble with the greatest
possible amount of their surface exposed to its surface. These animals are
evidently taking in oxygen by osmosis. They are breathing. A careful
inspection of the jar containing param&oelig;cia shows thousands of tiny
whitish bodies collected near the surface of the jar. In the
param&oelig;cium, as in the one-celled plants, the protoplasm composing the
cell responds to certain agencies acting upon it, coming from without;
these agencies we call <i>stimuli</i>. Such stimuli may be light,
differences of temperature, presence of food, electricity, or other factors
of its surroundings. Plant and animal cells may react differently to the
same stimulus. In general, however, we know that protoplasm is
<i>irritable</i> to some of these factors. To severe stimuli, <a
name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
168]</span>protoplasm usually responds by <i>contracting</i>, another power
which it possesses. We know, too, that plant and animal cells take in food
and change the food to protoplasm, that is, that they <i>assimilate</i>
food; and that they may waste away and repair themselves. Finally, we know
that new plant and animal cells are <i>reproduced</i> from the original bit
of protoplasm, a single cell.</p>

 <i>mi.n.</i>, micronucleus; <i>w.v.</i>, water vacuole.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Structure of Param&oelig;cium.</b>&mdash;The cell body is almost
transparent, and consists of semifluid protoplasm which has a granular
grayish appearance under the microscope. This protoplasm appears to be
bounded by a very delicate membrane through which project numerous delicate
threads of protoplasm called <i>cilia</i>. (These are usually invisible
under the microscope).</p>

<p>The locomotion of the param&oelig;cium is caused by the movement of
these cilia, which lash the water like a multitude of tiny oars. The cilia
also send particles of food into a funnel-like opening, the <i>gullet</i>,
on one side of the cell. Once inside the cell body, the particles of food
materials are gathered into little balls within the almost transparent
protoplasm. These masses of food seem to be inclosed within a little area
containing fluid, called a <i>vacuole</i>. Other vacuoles appear to be
clear; these are spaces in which food has been digested. One or two larger
vacuoles may be found; these are the <i>contractile vacuoles</i>; their
purpose seems to be to pass off waste material from the cell body. This is
done by pulsation of the vacuole, which ultimately bursts, passing fluid
waste to the outside. Solid wastes are passed out of the cell in somewhat
the same manner. No breathing organs are seen, because osmosis of oxygen
and carbon dioxide may take place anywhere through the cell membrane. The
nucleus of the cell is not easily visible in living specimens. In a cell
that has been stained it has been found to be a double <a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>structure,
consisting of one large and one small portion, called, respectively, the
<i>macronucleus</i> and the <i>micronucleus</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Reproduction of Param&oelig;cium.</b>&mdash;Sometimes a
param&oelig;cium may be found in the act of dividing by the process known
as <i>fission</i>, to form two new cells, each of which contains half of
the original cell. This is a method of <i>asexual</i> reproduction. The
original cell may thus form in succession many hundreds of cells in every
respect like the original parent cell.</p>

<p><b>Am&oelig;ba.</b><a name= "fnanchor_25" id= "fnanchor_25"></a><a href=
"#footnote_25" class= "fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;In order to understand more
fully the life of a simple bit of protoplasm, let us take up the study of
the <i>am&oelig;ba</i>, a type of the simplest form of animal life. Unlike
the plant and animal cells we have examined, the am&oelig;ba has no fixed
form. Viewed under the compound microscope, it has the appearance of an
irregular mass of granular protoplasm. Its form is constantly changing as
it moves about. This is due to the pushing out of tiny projections of the
protoplasm of the cell, called <i>pseudopodia</i> (false feet). The
locomotion is accomplished by a streaming or flowing of the semifluid
protoplasm. The pseudopodia are pushed forward in the direction which the
animal is to go, the rest of the body following. In the central part of the
cell is the nucleus. This important <a name="Page_170"
id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>organ is difficult
to see except in cells that have been stained.</p>

<p>Although but a single cell, still the am&oelig;ba appears to be aware of
the existence of food when it is near at hand. Food may be taken into the
body at any point, the semifluid protoplasm simply rolling over and
engulfing the food material. Within the body, as in the param&oelig;cium,
the food becomes inclosed within a fluid space or vacuole. The protoplasm
has the power to take out such material as it can use to form new
protoplasm or give energy. Circulation of food material is accomplished by
the constant streaming of the protoplasm within the cell.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Am&oelig;ba, showing the changes which take place
 during division of the cell. The dark body in each figure is the nucleus;
 the transparent circle, the contractile vacuole; the large granular
 masses, the food vacuoles. Much magnified.</p>
</div>

<p>The cell absorbs oxygen from the water by osmosis through its delicate
membrane, giving up carbon dioxide in return. Thus the cell "breathes"
through any part of its body covering.</p>

<p>Waste nitrogenous products formed within the cell when work is done are
passed out by means of the contractile vacuole.</p>

<p>The am&oelig;ba, like other one-celled organisms, reproduces by the
process of fission. A single cell divides by splitting into two others,
each of which resembles the parent cell, except that they are of less bulk.
When these become the size of the parent am&oelig;ba, they each in turn
divide. This is a kind of asexual reproduction.</p>

<p>When conditions unfavorable for life come, the am&oelig;ba, like some
one-celled plants, encysts itself within a membranous wall. In this
condition it may become dried and be blown through the air. Upon return to
a favorable environment, it <a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>begins life again, as before. In this
respect it resembles the spore of a plant.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Cell as a Unit.</b>&mdash;In the daily life of a one-celled
animal we find the single cell performing all the general activities which
we shall later find the many-celled animal is able to perform. In the
am&oelig;ba no definite parts of the cell appear to be set off to perform
certain functions; but any part of the cell can take in food, can absorb
oxygen, can change the food into protoplasm, and excrete the waste
material. The single cell is, in fact, an organism able to carry on the
business of living almost as effectually as a very complex animal.</p>

<p><b>Complex One-celled Animals.</b>&mdash;In the param&oelig;cium we find
a single cell, but we find certain parts of the cell having certain
definite functions: the cilia are used for locomotion; a definite part of
the cell takes in food, while the waste passes out at another definite
spot. In another one-celled animal called <i>vorticella</i>, part of the
cell has become elongated and is contractile. By this stalk the little
animal is fastened to a water plant or other object. The stalk may be said
to act like a muscle fiber, as its sole function seems to be movement; the
cilia are located at one end of the cell and serve to create a current of
water which will bring food particles to the mouth. Here we have several
parts of the cell, each doing a different kind of work. This is known as
<i>physiological division of labor</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
172]</span><b>Habitat of Protozoa.</b>&mdash;Protozoa are found almost
everywhere in shallow water, especially close to the surface. They appear
to be attracted near to the surface by the supply of oxygen. Every
fresh-water lake swarms with them; the ocean contains countless myriads of
many different forms.</p>

<p><b>Use as Food.</b>&mdash;They are so numerous in lakes, rivers, and the
ocean as to form the food for many animals higher in the scale of life.
Almost all fish that do not take the hook and that travel in schools, or
companies, migrating from one place to another, live partly on such food.
Many feed on slightly larger animals, which in turn eat the Protozoa. Such
fish have on each side of the mouth attached to the gills a series of small
structures looking like tiny rakes. These are called the <i>gill
rakers</i>, and aid in collecting tiny organisms from the water as it
passes over the gills. The whale, the largest of all mammals, strains
protozoans and other small animals and plants out of the water by means of
hanging plates of whalebone or baleen, the slender filaments of which form
a sieve from the top to the bottom of the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Protozoa cause Disease.</b>&mdash;Protozoa of certain kinds play an
important part in causing malaria, yellow fever, and other diseases, as we
shall see later.<a name= "fnanchor_26" id= "fnanchor_26"></a><a href=
"#footnote_26" class= "fnanchor">[26]</a> (See page <a
href="#Page_217">217</a>.)</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_25" id="footnote_25"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_25">[25]</a>
 Am&oelig;bæ <i>may</i> be obtained from the hay infusion, from the dead
 leaves in the bottom of small pools, from the same source in fresh-water
 aquaria, from the roots of duckweed or other small water plants, or from
 green algæ growing in quiet localities. No <i>sure</i> method of obtaining
 them can be given.</p>

<p class="footnote add"> <a name="footnote_26" id="footnote_26"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_26">[26]</a>
 Teachers may find it expedient to take up the study of protozoan diseases
 at this point.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Reproduction in Plants.</b>&mdash;Although there are very
many plants and animals so small and so simple as to be composed of but a
single cell, by far the greater part of the animal and plant world is made
up of individuals which are collections of cells living together.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A cell of pond scum. How might it divide to form a long
 thread made up of cells?</p>
</div>

<p>In a simple plant like the pond scum, a string or filament of cells is
formed by a single cell dividing crosswise, the two cells formed each
dividing into two more. Eventually a long thread of cells is thus formed.
At times, however, a cell is formed by the union of two cells, one from
each of two adjoining filaments of the plant. At length a hard coat forms
around this cell, which has now become a <i>spore</i>. The tough covering
protects it from unfavorable changes in the surroundings. <a
name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
174]</span>Later, when conditions become favorable for its germination, the
spore may form a new filament of pond scum. In molds, in yeasts, and in the
bacteria we also found spores could be formed by the protoplasm of the
plant cutting up into a number of tiny spores. These spores are called
<i>asexual</i> (without sex) because they are not formed by the union of
two cells, and may give rise to other tiny plants like themselves. Still
other plants, mosses and ferns, give rise to two kinds of spores, sexual
and asexual. All of these collectively are called <i>spore plants</i>.</p>

<p><b>Reproduction in Seed Plants.</b>&mdash;Another great group of plants
we have studied, plants of varied shapes and sizes, produce seeds. They
bear flowers and fruits.</p>

 plant; <i>H</i>, hypocotyl; <i>P</i>, plumule; <i>C</i>, cotyledons.</p>
</div>

<p>The embryo develops from a single fertilized "egg," growing by cell
division into two, four, eight, and a constantly increasing number of cells
until after a time a baby plant is formed, which as in the bean, either
contains some stored food to give it a start in life, or, as in the corn,
is surrounded with food which it can digest and absorb into its own tiny
body. We have seen that these young plants in the seed are able to develop
when conditions are favorable. Furthermore, the young of each kind of plant
will eventually develop into the kind of plant its parent was and into no
other kind. Thus the plant world is divided into many tribes or groups.</p>

<p><b>Plants are placed in Groups.</b>&mdash;If we plant a number of peas
so that they will all germinate under the same conditions of soil,
temperature, <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
175]</span>and sunlight, the seedlings that develop will each differ one
from another in a slight degree.<a name= "fnanchor_27" id=
"fnanchor_27"></a><a href= "#footnote_27" class= "fnanchor">[27]</a> But in
a general way they will have many characters in common, as the shape of the
leaves, the possession of tendrils, form of the flower and fruit. A
<i>species</i> of plants or animals is a group of individuals so much alike
in their characters that they might have had the same parents. Individuals
of such species differ slightly; for no two individuals are exactly
alike.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Rock fern, <i>polypody</i>. Notice the underground stem
 giving off roots from its lower surface, and leaves (<i>C</i>),
 (<i>S</i>), from its upper surface.</p>
</div>

<p>Species are grouped together in a larger group called a genus. For
example, many kinds of peas&mdash;the wild beach peas, the sweet peas, and
many others&mdash;are all grouped in one genus (called <i>Lathyrus</i>, or
vetchling) because they have certain structural characteristics in
common.</p>

<p>Plant and animal genera are brought together in still larger groups, the
classification based on general likenesses in structure. Such groups are
called, as they become successively larger, <i>Family</i>, <i>Order</i>,
and <i>Class</i>. Thus both the plant and animal kingdoms are grouped into
divisions, the smallest of which contains <a name="Page_176"
id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>individuals very
much alike; and the largest of which contains very many groups of
individuals, the groups having some characters in common. This is called a
system of classification.</p>

<p><b>Classification of the Plant Kingdom.</b>&mdash;The entire plant
kingdom has been divided into four sub-kingdoms by botanists:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Plant Kingdom Classification">

<tr><td class="leftc">1.&nbsp;<i>Spermatophytes.</i></td>
<td class="left"><i>Angiosperms</i>, true flowering plants.<br />

Algæ and the Fungi; the algæ being green, while the fungi have
no chlorophyll.</td></tr>

 <p class="caption">Rockweed, a brown algæ, showing its distribution on
 rocks below highwater mark.</p>
</div>

<p>The extent of the plant kingdom can only be hinted at; each year new
species are added to the lists. There are about 110,000 species of
flowering plants and nearly as many flowerless plants. The latter consist
of over 3500 species of fernlike plants, some 16,500 species of mosses,
over 5600 lichens (plants consisting of a <a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>partnership between
algæ and fungi), approximately 55,000 species of fungi, and about 16,000
species of algæ.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A moss plant. <i>G</i>, the moss body;
<i>S</i>, the spore-bearing stalk
(fruiting body).</p>
</div>

<p><b>Development of a Simple Animal.</b>&mdash;Many-celled animals are
formed in much the same way as are many-celled seed plants. A common bath
sponge, an earthworm, a fish, or a dog,&mdash;each and all of them begin
life in the same manner. In a many-celled animal the life history begins
with a single cell, the fertilized egg. As in the flowering plant, this
cell has been formed by the union of two other cells, a tiny (usually
motile) cell; the <i>sperm</i>, and a large cell, the <i>egg</i>. After the
egg is fertilized by a sperm cell, it splits into two, four, eight, and
sixteen cells; as the number of cells increases, a hollow ball of cells
called the <i>blastula</i> is formed; later this ball sinks in on one side,
and a double-walled cup of cells, now called a <i>gastrula</i>, results.
Practically all animals pass through the above stages in their development
from the egg, although these stages are often not plain to see because of
the presence of food material (yolk) in the egg.</p>

<p>In animals the body consists of three layers of cells: those of the
outside, developed from the outer layer of the gastrula, are called
<i>ectoderm</i>, which later gives rise to the skin, nervous system, etc.;
an inner layer, developed from the inner layer of the gastrula, the
<i>endoderm</i>, which forms the lining of the digestive organs, etc.; a
middle layer, called the <i>mesoderm</i>, lying between the ectoderm and
the endoderm, is also found. In higher animals this layer gives rise to
muscles, the skeleton, and parts of other internal structures.<a

 <p class="captionj">Photograph of a living <i>vorticella</i>, showing the
 contractile stalk and the cilia around the mouth. Compare this figure with
 that of the param&oelig;cium. Which cell shows greater division of
 labor?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Physiological Division of Labor.</b>&mdash;If we compare the
am&oelig;ba and the param&oelig;cium, we find the latter a more complex
organism than the former. An am&oelig;ba may take in food through any part
of the body; the param&oelig;cium has a definite gullet; the am&oelig;ba
may use any part of the body for locomotion; the param&oelig;cium has
definite parts of the cell, the cilia, fitted for this work. Since the
structure of the param&oelig;cium is more complex, we say that it is a
"higher" animal. In the vorticella, a still more complex cell, part of the
cell has grown out like a stalk, has become contractile, and acts like
muscle.</p>

<p>As we look higher in the scale of life, we invariably find that certain
parts of a plant or animal are set apart to do certain work, and only that
work. Just as in a community of people, there are some men who do rough
manual work, others who are skilled workmen, some who are shopkeepers, and
still others who are professional <a name="Page_179"
id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>men, so among plants
and animals, wherever <i>collections</i> of cells live together to form an
organism, there is division of labor, some cells being fitted to do one
kind of work, while others are fitted to do work of another sort. This is
called physiological division of labor.</p>

 cells.</p>
</div>

<p>As we have seen, the higher plants are made up of a vast number of cells
of many kinds. Collections of cells alike in structure and performing the
same function we have called a <i>tissue</i>. Examples of animal tissues
are the highly contractile cells set apart for movement, <i>muscles</i>;
those which cover the body or line the inner parts of organs, the skin, or
<i>epithelium</i>; the cells which form secretions or <i>glands</i> and the
sensitive cells forming the <i>nervous</i> tissues.</p>

<p>Frequently several tissues have certain <a name="Page_180"
id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>functions to perform
in conjunction with one another. The arm of the human body performs
movement. To do this, several tissues, as muscles, nerves, and bones, must
act together. A collection of tissues performing certain work we call an
<i>organ</i>.</p>

 or large cilia (<i>fla</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>In a simple animal like a sponge, division of labor occurs between the
cells; some cells which line the pores leading inward create a current of
water, and feed upon the minute organisms which come within reach, other
cells build the skeleton of the sponge, and still others become eggs or
sperms. In higher animals more complicated in structure and in which the
tissues are found working together to form organs, division of labor is
much more highly specialized. In the human arm, an organ fitted for certain
movements, think of the number of tissues and the complicated actions which
are possible. The most extreme division of labor is seen in the organism
which has the most complex actions to perform and whose organs are fitted
for such work, for there the cells or tissues which do the particular work
do it quickly and very well.</p>

<p>In our daily life in a town or city we see division of labor between
individuals. Such division of labor may occur among other animals, as, for
example, bees or ants. But it is seen at its highest in a great city or in
a large business or industry. In the stockyards of Chicago, division of
labor has resulted in certain men performing but a single movement during
their entire day's work, but this movement repeated so many times in a day
has resulted in wonderful accuracy and speed. Thus division of labor
obtains its end.</p>

<p><b>Organs and Functions Common to All Animals.</b>&mdash;The same
general functions performed by a single cell are performed by a <a
name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
181]</span>many-celled animal. But in the many-celled animals the various
functions of the single cell are taken up by the organs. In a complex
organism, like man, the organs and the functions they perform may be
briefly given as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The organs of <i>food taking</i>: food may be taken in by individual
cells, as those lining the pores of the sponge, or definite parts of a food
tube may be set apart for this purpose, as the mouth and parts which place
food in the mouth.</p>

<p>(2) The organs of <i>digestion</i>: the food tube and collections of
cells which form the glands connected with it. The enzymes in the fluids
secreted by the latter change the foods from a solid form (usually
insoluble) to that of a <i>fluid</i>. Such fluid may then pass by osmosis,
through the walls of the food tube into the blood.</p>

<p>(3) The organs of <i>circulation</i>: the tubes through which the blood,
bearing its organic foods and oxygen, reaches the tissues of the body. In
simple animals, as the sponge and hydra, no such organs are needed, the
fluid food passing from cell to cell by osmosis.</p>

<p>(4) The organs of <i>respiration</i>: the organs in which the blood
receives oxygen and gives up carbon dioxide. The outer layer of the body
serves this purpose in very simple animals; gills or lungs are developed in
more complex animals.</p>

<p>(5) The organs of <i>excretion</i>: such as the kidneys and skin, which
pass off nitrogenous and other waste matters from the body.</p>

<p>(6) The organs of <i>locomotion</i>: muscles and their attachments and
connectives; namely, tendons, ligaments, and bones.</p>

<p>(7) The organs of <i>nervous control</i>: the central nervous system,
which has control of coördinated movement. This consists of scattered cells
in low forms of life; such cells are collected into groups and connected
with each other in higher animals.</p>

<p>(8) The organs of <i>sense</i>: collections of cells having to do with
the reception and transmission of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch,
pressure, and temperature sensations.</p>

<p>(9) The organs of <i>reproduction</i>: the sperm and egg-forming
organs.</p>

<p>Almost all animals have the functions mentioned above. In most, the
various organs mentioned are more or less developed, although in the
simpler forms of animal life some of the organs <a name="Page_182"

either very poorly developed or entirely lacking. But in the so-called
"higher" animals each of the above-named functions is assigned to a certain
organ or group of organs. The work is done better and more quickly than in
the "lower" animals. Division of labor is thus a guide in helping us to
determine the place of animals in the groups that exist on the earth.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Animal Series.</b>&mdash;We have found that a one-celled animal
can perform certain functions in a rather crude manner. Man can perform
these same functions in an extremely efficient manner. Division of labor is
well worked out, extreme complexity of structure is seen. Between these two
extremes are a great many groups of animals which can be arranged more or
less as a series, showing the gradual evolution or development of life on
the earth. It will be the purpose of the following pages to show the chief
characteristics of the great groups of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p><b>I. Protozoa.</b>&mdash;Animals composed of a single cell, reproducing
by cell division.</p>

<p class="smaller">The following are the principal classes of Protozoa,
examples of which we may have seen or read about:&mdash;</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Class I.</span> <i>Rhizopoda</i>
(Greek for <i>root-footed</i>). Having no fixed form, with pseudopodia.
Either naked as <i>Am&oelig;ba</i> or building limy (<i>Foraminifera</i>)
or glasslike skeletons (<i>Radiolaria</i>).</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Class II.</span> <i>Infusoria (in
infusions).</i> Usually active ciliated Protozoa. Examples,
<i>Param&oelig;cium</i>, <i>Vorticella</i>.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Class III.</span> <i>Sporozoa (spore
animals).</i> Parasitic and usually nonactive. Example, <i>Plasmodium
malariæ</i>.</p>

<p><b>II. Sponges.</b>&mdash;Because the body contains many pores through
which water bearing food particles enters, these animals are called
<i>Porifera</i>. They are classed according to the skeleton they possess
into limy, glasslike, and horny fiber sponges. The latter are <a
name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>the
sponges of commerce. With but few exceptions sponges live in salt water and
are never free swimming.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A horny fiber sponge. Notice that it is a colony. One
 fourth natural size.</p>
</div>

<p><b>III. C&oelig;lenterates.</b>&mdash;The hydra and its salt-water
allies, the jellyfish, hydroids, and corals, belong to a group of animals
known as the <i>C&oelig;lenterata</i>. The word "c&oelig;lenterate"
(<i>c&oelig;lom</i> = body cavity, <i>enteron</i> = food tube) explains the
structure of the group. They are animals in which the real body cavity is
lacking, the animal in its simplest form being little more than a bag. Some
examples are the hydra, shown on page 179, salt-water forms known as
hydroids, colonial forms which have part of their life free swimming as
jellyfish; sea anemones and coral polyps, tiny colonial hydra like forms
which build a living or secreted covering.</p>

 specimen is expanded and shows the mouth surrounded by the tentacles. The
 left hand specimen is contracted. (From model at the American Museum of
 Natural History.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>IV. Worms.</b>&mdash;The wormlike animals are grouped into
<i>flatworms</i>, <i>roundworms</i>, and segmented or <i>jointed</i>
worms.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Flatworms are sometimes parasitic, examples being the
tapeworm and liver fluke. They are usually small, ribbon- or leaf-like and
flat and live in water.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Roundworms, minute threadlike creatures, are not often seen
by the city girl or boy. Vinegar eels, the horsehair worm, the pork worm or
trichina and the dread hookworm are examples.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Segmented worms are long, jointed creatures composed of <a
name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>body
rings or segments. Examples are the earthworm, the sandworm (known to New
York boys as the fishworm), and the leeches or bloodsuckers.</p>

 feet. About one half natural size.</p>

<p><b>V. Echinoderms.</b>&mdash;These are spiny-skinned animals, which live
in salt water. They are still more complicated in structure <a
name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>than
the worms and may be known by the spines in their skin. They show radial
symmetry. Starfish or sea urchins are examples.</p>

 little reduced.</p>
</div>

<p><b>VI. Arthropods.</b>&mdash;These animals are distinguished by having
jointed body and legs. They form two great groups. The higher forms of the
<i>Crustacea</i> have only two regions in the body, a fused head and
thorax, called the <i>cephalothorax</i>, and an abdominal region. A second
group is the <i>Insecta</i>, of which we know something already. Crustacea
breathe by means of <i>gills</i>, which are structures for taking oxygen
out of the water, while adult insects breathe through air tubes called
<i>trachea</i>.</p>

 <p class="captionj">A common snail, a mollusk. (From a photograph by

</div>

<p>Two smaller groups of arthropods also exist, the <i>Arachnida</i>,
consisting of spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites, and the
<i>Myriapoda</i>, examples being the "thousand leggers" found in some city
houses.</p>

<p><b>VII. Mollusca.</b>&mdash;Another large group is the Mollusca. This
phylum gets its name from the soft, unsegmented body (<i>mollis</i> =
soft). Mollusks usually have a shell, which may be of one piece, as a
snail, or two pieces or <i>valves</i>, as the clam or oyster.</p>

 <p class="caption">The skeleton of a dog; a typical vertebrate.</p>
</div>

<p><b>VIII.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Vertebrates.</b>&mdash;All of the animals we have
studied thus far agree in having whatever skeleton or hard parts they
possess on the outside of the body. Collectively, they are called
<i>Invertebrates</i>. This exoskeleton differs from the main or axial
skeleton of the higher animals, the latter being inside of the body. The
exoskeleton is dead, being secreted by the cells lining the body, while the
endoskeleton is, in part at least, alive and is capable of growth,
<i>e.g.</i> a broken arm or leg bone will grow together. <a name="Page_186"
id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>But a man has
certain parts of the skeleton, as nails or hair, formed by the skin and in
addition possesses inside bones to which the muscles are attached. Some of
the bones are arranged in a flexible column in the <i>dorsal</i> (the back)
side of the body. This <i>vertebral column</i>, as it is called, is
distinctive of all <i>vertebrates</i>. Within its bony protection lies the
delicate central nervous system, and to this column are attached the big
bones of the legs and arms. The vertebrate animals deserve more of our
attention than other forms of life because man himself is a vertebrate.</p>

<p>Five groups or classes of vertebrates exist. <i>Fishes</i>,
<i>Amphibians</i>, <i>Reptiles</i>, <i>Birds</i>, and <i>Mammals</i>. Let
us see how to distinguish one class from another.</p>

 <p class="caption">The sturgeon, a ganoid fish.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Fishes.</b>&mdash;Fishes are familiar animals to most of us. We know
that they live in the water, have a backbone, and that they have fins. They
breathe by means of gills, delicate organs fitted for taking oxygen out of
the water. The heart has two chambers, an auricle and a ventricle. They
have a skin in which are glands <a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>secreting mucus, a slimy substance which
helps them go through the water easily. They usually lay very many
eggs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Classification of Fishes</span></p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Order I.</span> <i>The
Elasmobranchs.</i> Fishes which have a soft skeleton made of cartilage and
exposed gill slits. Examples: sharks, skates, and rays.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Order II.</span> <i>The Ganoids.</i>
Fishes which once were very numerous on the earth, but which are now almost
extinct. They are protected by platelike scales. Examples: gars, sturgeon,
and bowfin.</p>

or Bony Fishes.</i> They compose 95 per cent of all living fishes. In this
group the skeleton is bony, the gills are protected by an operculum, and
the eggs are numerous. Most of our common food fishes belong to this
class.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Order IV.</span> <i>The Dipnoi, or
Lung Fishes.</i> This is a very small group. In many respects they are more
like amphibians than fishes, the swim bladder being used as a lung. They
live in tropical Africa, South America, and Australia, inhabiting the
rivers and lakes there.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Characteristics of Amphibia.</b>&mdash;The frog belongs to the class
of vertebrates known as Amphibia. As the name indicates (<i>amphi</i>,
both, and <i>bia</i>, life), members of this group live both in water and
on land. In the earlier stages of their development they take oxygen into
the blood by means of gills. When adult, however, they breathe by means of
lungs. At all times, but especially during the winter, the skin serves as a
breathing organ. The skin is soft and unprotected by bony plates or scales.
The heart has three chambers, two auricles and one ventricle. Most
amphibians undergo a complete metamorphosis, or change of form, the young
being unlike the adults.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Order II.</span> <i>Anura.</i>
Tailless Amphibia, which undergo a metamorphosis, breathing by gills in
larval state, by lungs in adult state. Examples: toad and frog.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Characteristics of Reptilia.</b>&mdash;These animals are
characterized by having scales developed from the skin. In the turtle they
have become bony and are connected with the internal skeleton. Reptiles
always breathe by means of lungs, differing in this respect from the
amphibians. They show their distant relationship to birds in that their
large eggs are incased in a leathery, limy shell.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Birds.</b>&mdash;Birds among all other animals are known by their
covering of feathers and the presence of wings. The feathers are developed
from the skin. These aid in flight, and protect the body from the cold.</p>

<p>The form of the bill in particular shows adaptation to a wonderful
degree. A duck has a flat bill for pushing through the mud and straining
out the food; a bird of prey has a curved or hooked beak for tearing; the
woodpecker has a sharp, straight bill for piercing the bark of trees in
search of the insect larvæ which are hidden underneath. Birds do not have
teeth.<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

 <p class="captionj">Common tern and young, showing nesting and feeding
 habits. (From group at American Museum of Natural History.)</p>
</div>

<p>The rate of respiration, of heartbeat, and the body temperature are all
higher in the bird than in man. Man breathes from twelve to fourteen times
per minute. Birds breathe from twenty to sixty times a minute. Because of
the increased activity of a bird, there comes a necessity for a greater and
more rapid supply of oxygen, an increased blood supply to carry the
material to be used up in the release of energy, and a means of rapid
excretion of the wastes resulting from the process of oxidation. Birds are
large eaters, and the digestive tract is fitted to digest the food quickly,
by having a large crop in which food may be stored in a much softened
condition. As soon as the food is part of the blood, it may be sent rapidly
to the places where it is needed, by means of the large four-chambered
heart and large blood vessels.</p>

<p>The high temperature of the bird is a direct result of this rapid
oxidation; furthermore, the feathers and the oily skin form an insulation
which does not readily permit of the escape of heat. This insulating cover
is of much use to the bird in its flights at <a name="Page_191"
id="Page_191"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>high altitudes,
where the temperature is often very low. Birds lay eggs and usually care
for their young.</p>

swift, humming bird, and goatsucker.</p>

<p><b>Mammals.</b>&mdash;Dogs and cats, sheep and pigs, horses and cows,
all of our domestic animals (and man himself) have characters of structure
which cause them to be classed as mammals. They, like some other
vertebrates, have lungs and warm blood. They also have a hairy covering and
bear young developed to a form similar to their own,<a name= "fnanchor_28"
id= "fnanchor_28"></a><a href= "#footnote_28" class= "fnanchor">[28]</a>
and nurse them with milk secreted by glands known as the <i>mammary
glands</i>; hence the term "mammal."<a name="Page_192"

<p><b>Adaptations in Mammalia.</b>&mdash;Of the thirty-five hundred
species, most inhabit continents; a few species are found on different
islands, and some, as the whale, inhabit the ocean. They vary in size from
the whale and the elephant to tiny shrew mice and moles. Adaptations to
different habitat and methods of life abound; the seal and whale have the
limbs modified into flippers, the sloth and squirrel have limbs peculiarly
adapted to climbing, while the bats have the fore limbs modeled for
flight.</p>

<p><b>Lowest Mammals.</b>&mdash;The lowest are the monotremes, animals
which lay eggs like the birds, although they are provided with hairy
covering like other mammals. Such are the Australian spiny anteater and the
duck mole.</p>

<p>All other mammals bring forth their young developed to a form similar to
their own. The kangaroo and opossum, however, are provided with a pouch on
the under side of the body in which the very immature, blind, and helpless
young are nourished until they are able to care for themselves. These
pouched animals are called <i>marsupials</i>.</p>

<p><b>Increasing Complexity of Structure and of Habits in Plants and
Animals.</b>&mdash;In our study of biology so far we have attempted to get
some notion of the various factors which act upon living things. We have
seen how plants and animals interact upon each other. We have learned
something about the various physiological processes of plants and animals,
and have found them to be in many respects identical. We have found grades
of complexity in plants from the one-celled plant, bacterium or
pleurococcus, to the complicated flowering plants of considerable size and
with many organs. So in animal life, from the Protozoa upward, there is
constant change, and the change is toward greater complexity of structure
and functions. An insect is a higher type of life than a protozoan, because
its structure is more complex and it can perform its work with more ease
and accuracy. A fish is a higher type of animal than the insect for these
same reasons, and also for another. The fish has an internal skeleton which
forms a pointed column of bones on the <i>dorsal</i> side (the back) of the
animal. It is a vertebrate animal.<a name="Page_194"

</div>

<p><b>The Doctrine of Evolution.</b>&mdash;We have now learned that animal
forms may be arranged so as to begin with very simple one-celled forms and
culminate with a group which contains man himself. This arrangement is
called the <i>evolutionary series</i>. Evolution means change, and these
groups are believed by scientists to represent stages in complexity of
development of life on the earth. Geology teaches that millions of years
ago, life upon the earth was very simple, and that gradually more and more
complex forms of life appeared, as the rocks formed latest in time show the
most highly developed forms of animal life. The great English scientist,
Charles Darwin, from this and other evidence, explained the theory of
evolution. This is the belief that simple forms of life on the earth slowly
and gradually gave rise to those more complex and that thus ultimately the
most complex forms came into existence.</p>

animals are known to exist to-day, as the following table shows.</p>

195]</span> <b>Man's Place in Nature.</b>&mdash;Although we know that man
is separated mentally by a wide gap from all other animals, in our study of
physiology we must ask where we are to place man. If we attempt to classify
man, we see at once he must be placed with the vertebrate animals because
of his possession of a vertebral column. Evidently, too, he is a mammal,
because the young are nourished by milk secreted by the mother and because
his body has at least a partial covering of hair. Anatomically we find that
we must place man with the apelike mammals, because of these numerous
points of structural likeness. The group of mammals which includes the
monkeys, apes, and man we call the <i>primates</i>.</p>

<p>Although anatomically there is a greater difference between the lowest
type of monkey and the highest type of ape than there is between the
highest type of ape and the lowest savage, yet there is an immense mental
gap between monkey and man.</p>

<p><b>Instincts.</b>&mdash;Mammals are considered the highest of vertebrate
animals, not only because of their complicated structure, but because their
instincts are so well developed. Monkeys certainly seem to have many of the
mental attributes of man.</p>

<p>Professor Thorndike of Columbia University sums up their habits of
learning as follows:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">"In their method of learning, although monkeys do not
reach the human stage of a rich life of ideas, yet they carry the animal
method of learning, by the selection of impulses and association of them
with different sense-impressions, to a point beyond that reached by any
other of the lower animals. In this, too, they resemble man; for he differs
from the lower animals not only in the possession of a new sort of
intelligence, but also in the tremendous extension of that sort which he
has in common with them. A fish learns slowly a few simple habits. Man
learns quickly an infinitude of habits that may be highly complex. Dogs and
cats learn more than the fish, while monkeys learn more than they. In the
number of things he learns, the complex habits he can form, the variety of
lines along which he can learn them, and in their permanence when once
formed, the monkey justifies his inclusion with man in a separate mental
genus."</p>

<p><b>Evolution of Man.</b>&mdash;Undoubtedly there once lived upon the
earth races of men who were much lower in their mental organization than
the present inhabitants. If we follow the early history <a name="Page_196"
id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>of man upon the
earth, we find that at first he must have been little better than one of
the lower animals. He was a nomad, wandering from place to place, feeding
upon whatever living things he could kill with his hands. Gradually he must
have learned to use weapons, and thus kill his prey, first using rough
stone implements for this purpose. As man became more civilized, implements
of bronze and of iron were used. About this time the subjugation and
domestication of animals began to take place. Man then began to cultivate
the fields, and to have a fixed place of abode other than a cave. The
beginnings of civilization were long ago, but even to-day the earth is not
entirely civilized.</p>

<p><b>The Races of Man.</b>&mdash;At the present time there exist upon the
earth five races or varieties of man, each very different from the other in
instincts, social customs, and, to an extent, in structure. These are the
Ethiopian or negro type, originating in Africa; the Malay or brown race,
from the islands of the Pacific; the American Indian; the Mongolian or
yellow race, including the natives of China, Japan, and the Eskimos; and
finally, the highest type of all, the Caucasians, represented by the
civilized white inhabitants of Europe and America.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Laboratory Suggestions</span></p>

<p class="indentref">Inasmuch as this work is planned for the winter months
the laboratory side must be largely museum and reference work. It is to be
expected that the teacher will wish to refer to much of this work at the
time work is done on a given group. But it is pedagogically desirable that
the work as planned should be <i>varied</i>. Interest is thus held.
Outlines prepared by the teacher to be filled in by the student are
desirable because they lead the pupil to individual selection of what seems
to <i>him</i> as important material. Opportunity should be given for
laboratory exercises based on original sources. The pupils should be made
to use reports of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Biological
Survey, various States Reports, and others.</p>

<p class="demo">Special home laboratory reports may be well made at this
time, for example: determination at a local fish market of the fish that
are cheap and fresh at a given time. Have the students give reasons for
this. Study conditions in the meat market in a similar manner. Other local
food conditions may also be studied first hand.</p>

<p class="center p2"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span><span class="smcap">uses of animals</span></p>

<p><b>Indirect Use as Food.</b>&mdash;Just as plants form the food of
animals, so some animals are food for others. Man may make use of such food
directly or indirectly. Many mollusks, as the barnacle and mussel, are
eaten by fishes. Other fish live upon tiny organisms, water fleas and other
small crustaceans. These in turn feed upon still smaller animals, and we
may go back and back until finally we come to the Protozoa and one-celled
water plants as an ultimate source of food.</p>

 <p class="captionj">North American lobster. This specimen, preserved at
 the U.&nbsp;S. Fish Commission at Woods Hole, was of unusual size and weighed
 over twenty pounds.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Direct Use as Food. Lower Forms.</b>&mdash;The forms of life lower
than the Crustacea are of little use directly as food, although the Chinese
are very fond of one of the Echinoderms, a holothurian.</p>

<p><b>Crustacea as Food.</b>&mdash;Crustaceans, however, are of
considerable value for food, the lobster fisheries in particular being of
importance. The lobster is highly esteemed as food, and is rapidly
disappearing from our coasts as the result of overfishing. Between twenty
and thirty million are yearly taken on the North Atlantic coast. This means
a value at present prices of about $15,000,000. Laws have been enacted in
New York and other states against overfishing. Egg-carrying lobsters must
be returned to the water; all smaller than six to nine inches in length
(the law varies in different states) must be put back; other restrictions
are placed upon the taking of the animals, in hope of saving the race from
extinction. Some states now hatch and care for the young for a period of
time; the United States Bureau of Fisheries is also doing much good work,
in the hope of restocking to some extent the now almost depleted
waters.</p>

<p><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
199]</span> Several other common crustaceans are near relatives of the
crayfish. Among them are the shrimp and prawn, thin-shelled, active
crustaceans common along our eastern coast. In spite of the fact that they
form a large part of the food supply of many marine animals, especially
fish, they do not appear to be decreasing in numbers. They are also used as
food by man, the shrimp fisheries in this country aggregating over
$1,000,000 yearly.</p>

 <p class="captionj">The edible blue crab. (From a photograph loaned by the
 American Museum of Natural History.)</p>
</div>

<p>Another edible crustacean of considerable economic importance is the
blue crab. Crabs are found inhabiting muddy bottoms; in such localities
they are caught in great numbers in nets or traps baited with decaying
meat. They are, indeed, among our most valuable sea scavengers, although
they are carnivorous hunters as well. The young crabs differ considerably
in form from the adult. They undergo a complete <i>metamorphosis</i>
(change of form). Immediately after molting or shedding of the outer shell
in order to grow larger, crabs are greatly desired by man as an article of
food. They are then known as "shedders," or soft-shelled crabs.</p>

<p><b>Mollusks as Food.</b>&mdash;Oysters are never found in muddy
localities, for in such places they would be quickly smothered by the
sediment in the water. They are found in nature clinging to stones or on
shells or other objects which project a little above the bottom. Here food
is abundant and oxygen is obtained from the water surrounding them. Hence
oyster raisers throw oyster shells into the water and the young oysters
attach themselves.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px">
 <img src="images/i203b.jpg"
 width="200" height="103"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">The oyster.</p>
</div>

<p>In some parts of Europe and this country where oysters are raised
artificially, stakes or brush are sunk in shallow water so that the young
oyster, which is at first free-swimming, may escape the danger of
smothering on the bottom. After the oysters are a year or two old, they are
taken up and put down in deeper water as seed oysters. At the age of three
and four years they are ready for the market.</p>

<p>The oyster industry is one of the most profitable of our fisheries.
Nearly <a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
200]</span> $15,000,000 a year has been derived during the last decade from
such sources. Hundreds of boats and thousands of men are engaged in
dredging for oysters. Three of the most important of our oyster grounds are
Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, and Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">

 <p class="captionj">This diagram shows how cases of intestinal disease
 (typhoid and diarrh&oelig;a) have been traced to oysters from a locality
 where they were"fattened" in water contaminated with sewage. (Loaned by
 American Museum of Natural History.)</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes oysters are artificially "fattened" by placing them on beds
near the mouths of fresh-water streams. Too often these streams are the
bearers of much sewage, and the oyster, which lives on microscopic
organisms, takes in a number of bacteria with other food. Thus a person
might become infected with the typhoid bacillus by eating raw oysters.
State and city supervision of the oyster industry makes this possibility
very much less than it was a few years ago, as careful bacteriological
analysis of the surrounding water is constantly made by competent
experts.</p>

<p><b>Clams.</b>&mdash;Other bivalve mollusks used for food are clams and
scallops. Two species of the former are known to New Yorkers, one as the
"round," another as the "long" or "soft-shelled" clams. The former
(<i>Venus mercenaria</i>) was called by the Indians "quahog," and is still
so called in the Eastern states. The blue area of its shell was used by the
Indians to make wampum, or money. The quahog is now extensively used as
food. The "long" clam (<i>Mya arenaria</i>) is considered better eating by
the inhabitants of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. This clam was highly
prized as food by the Indians. The clam industries of <a name="Page_201"
id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span> the eastern coast
aggregate nearly $1,000,000 a year. The dredging for scallops, another
molluscan delicacy, forms an important industry along certain parts of the
eastern coast.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Salmon leaping a fall on their way to their spawning
 beds. (Photographed by Dr. John A. Sampson.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Fish as Food.</b>&mdash;Fish are used as food the world over. From
very early times the herring were pursued by the Norsemen. Fresh-water
fish, such as whitefish, perch, pickerel, pike, and the various members of
the trout family, are esteemed food and, especially in the Great Lake
region, form important fisheries. But by far the most important food fishes
are those which are taken in salt water. Here we have two types of
fisheries, those where the fish comes up a river to spawn, as the salmon,
sturgeon, or shad, and those in which fishes are taken on their feeding
grounds in the open ocean. Herring are the world's most important catch,
though not in this country. Here the salmon of the western <a
name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
202]</span>coast is taken to the value of over $13,000,000 a year. Cod
fishing also forms an important industry; over 7000 men being employed and
over $2,000,000 of codfish being taken each year in this country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i205b.jpg"
 width="500" height="257"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Globe Fisheries.</p>
</div>

<p>Hundreds of other species of fish are used as food, the fish that is
nearest at hand being often the cheapest and best. Why, for example, is the
flounder so cheap in the New York markets? In what waters are the cod and
herring fisheries, sardine, oyster, sponge, pearl oyster? (See chart<a
name= "fnanchor_TN3" id= "fnanchor_TN3"></a><a href= "#footnote_TN3" class=
"fnanchor">[TN3]</a> on page 201.)</p>

<p><b>Amphibia and Reptiles as Food.</b>&mdash;Frogs' legs are esteemed a
delicacy. Certain reptiles are used as food by people of other
nationalities, the Iguana, a Mexican lizard, being an example. Many of the
sea-water turtles are of large size, the leatherback and the green turtle
often weighing six hundred to seven hundred pounds each. The flesh of the
green turtle and especially of the diamond-back terrapin, an animal found
in the salt marshes along our southeastern coast, is highly esteemed as
food. Unfortunately for the preservation of the species, these animals are
usually taken during the breeding season when they go to sandy beaches to
lay their eggs.</p>

<p><b>Birds as Food.</b>&mdash;Birds, both wild and domesticated, form part
of our food supply. Unfortunately our wild game birds are disappearing so
fast that we should not consider them as a source of food. Our domestic
fowls, turkey, ducks, etc., form an important food supply and poultry farms
give lucrative employment to many people. Eggs of domesticated birds are of
great importance as food, and egg albumin is used for other
purposes,&mdash;clarifying sugars, coating photographic papers, etc.</p>

<p><b>Mammals as Food.</b>&mdash;When we consider the amount of wealth
invested in cattle and other domesticated animals bred and used for food in
the United States, we see the great economic importance of mammals. The
United States, Argentina, and Australia are the greatest producers of
cattle. In this country hogs are largely raised for food. They are used
fresh, salted, smoked as ham and bacon, and pickled. Sheep, which are
raised in great quantities in Australia, Argentina, Russia, Uruguay, and
this country, are one of the world's greatest meat supplies.</p>

<p><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
203]</span> Goats, deer, many larger game animals, seals, walruses, etc.,
give food to people who live in parts of the earth that are less densely
populated.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Feeding silkworms. The caterpillars are the white
 objects in the trays.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Domesticated Animals.</b>&mdash; When man emerged from his savage
state on the earth, one of the first signs of the beginning of civilization
was the domestication of animals. The dog, the cow, sheep, and especially
the horse, mark epochs in the advance of civilization. Beasts of burden are
used the world over, horses almost all over the world, certain cattle, as
the water buffalo, in tropical Malaysia; camels, goats, and the llama are
also used as draft animals in some other countries.</p>

<p>Man's wealth in many parts of the world is estimated in terms of his
cattle or herds of sheep. So many products come from these sources that a
long list might be given, such as meats, milk, butter, cheese, wool, or
other body coverings, leather, skins, and hides used for other purposes.
Great industries are directly dependent upon our domesticated animals, as
the making of shoes, the manufacture of woolen cloth, the tanning industry,
and many others.</p>

<p><b>Uses for Clothing.</b>&mdash;The manufacture of silk is due to the
production of raw silk by the silkworm, the caterpillar of a moth. It lives
upon the mulberry and makes a cocoon from which the silk is wound. The
Chinese silkworm is now raised to a slight extent in southern California.
China, Japan, Italy, and France, because of cheaper labor, are the most
successful silk-raising countries.</p>

<p>The use of wool gives rise to many great industries. After the wool is
cut from the sheep, it has to be washed and scoured to <a name="Page_204"
id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>get out the dirt and
grease. This wool fat or lanoline is used in making soap and ointments. The
wool is next "carded," the fibers being interwoven by the fine teeth of the
carding machine or "combed," the fibers here being pulled out parallel to
each other. Carded wool becomes woolen goods; combed wool, worsted goods.
The wastes are also utilized, being mixed with "shoddy" (wool from cloth
cuttings or rags) to make woolen goods of a cheap grade.</p>

<p>Goat hair, especially that of the Angora and the Cashmere goat, has much
use in the clothing industries. Camel's hair and alpaca are also used.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">

 width="300" height="253"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Polar bear, a fur-bearing mammal which is rapidly being
 exterminated. Why?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Fur.</b>&mdash;The furs of many domesticated and wild animals are of
importance. The Carnivora as a group are of much economic importance as the
source of most of our fur. The fur seal fisheries alone amount to many
millions of dollars annually. Otters, skunks, sables, weasels, foxes, and
minks are of considerable importance as fur producers. Even cats are now
used for fur, usually masquerading under some other name. The fur of the
beaver, one of the largest of the rodents or gnawing mammals, is of
considerable value, as are the coats of the chinchilla, muskrats,
squirrels, and other rodents. The fur of the rabbit and nutria are used in
the manufacture of felt hats. The quills of the porcupines (greatly
developed and stiffened hairs) have a slight commercial value.</p>

<p><b>Conservation of Fur-bearing Animals Needed.</b>&mdash;As time goes on
and the furs of wild animals become scarcer and scarcer through
overkilling, we find the need for protection and conservation of many of
these fast-vanishing wild forms more and more imperative. <a
name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
205]</span>Already breeding of some fur-bearing animals has been tried with
success, and cheap substitutes for wild animal skins are coming more and
more into the markets. Black-fox breeding has been tried successfully in
Prince Edward Island, Canada, $2500 to $3000 being given for a single skin.
Skunk, marten, and mink are also being bred for the market. Game preserves
in this country and Canada are also helping to preserve our wild
fur-bearing animals.</p>

<p><b>Animal Oils.</b>&mdash;Whale oil, obtained from the fat or "blubber"
of whales, is used extensively for lubricating. Neat's-foot oil comes from
the feet of cattle and is also used in lubrication. Tallow and lard, two
fats from cattle, sheep, and pigs, have so many well-known uses that
comment is unnecessary. Cod-liver oil is used medically and is well known.
But it is not so widely known that a fish called the menhaden or "moss
bunkers" of the Atlantic coast produces over 3,000,000 gallons of oil every
year and is being rapidly exterminated in consequence.</p>

<p><b>Hides, Horns, Hoofs, etc.</b>&mdash;Leathers, from cattle, horses,
sheep, and goats, are used everywhere. Leather manufacture is one of the
great industries of the Eastern states, hundreds of millions of dollars
being invested in its manufacturing plants. Horns and bones are utilized
for making combs, buttons, handles for brushes, etc. Glue is made from the
animal matter in bones. Ivory, obtained from elephant, walrus, and other
tusks, forms a valuable commercial product. It is largely used for knife
handles, piano keys, combs, etc.</p>

<p><b>Perfumes.</b>&mdash;The musk deer, musk ox, and muskrat furnish a
valuable perfume called musk. Civet cats also give us a somewhat similar
perfume. Ambergris, a basis for delicate perfumes, comes from the
intestines of the sperm whale.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Protozoa.</b>&mdash;The Protozoa have played an
important part in rock building. The chalk beds of Kansas and other chalk
formations are made up to a large extent of the tiny skeletons of
<i>Protozoa</i>, called <i>Foraminifera</i>. Some limestone rocks are also
composed in large part of such skeletons. The skeletons of some species are
used to make a polishing powder.<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Sponges.</b>&mdash;The sponges of commerce have the
skeleton composed of tough fibers of material somewhat like that of cow's
horn. This fiber is elastic and has the power of absorbing water. In a
living state, the horny fiber sponge is a dark-colored fleshy mass, usually
found attached to rocks. The warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the
West Indies furnish most of our sponges. The sponges are pulled up from
their resting place on the bottom, by means of long-handled rakes operated
by men in boats or are secured by divers. They are then spread out on the
shore in the sun, and the living tissues allowed to decay; then after
treatment consisting of beating, bleaching, and trimming, the bath sponge
is ready for the market. Some forms of coral are of commercial value. The
red coral of the Mediterranean Sea is the best example.</p>

</div>

<p class="smaller"><b>Pearls and Mother of Pearl.</b>&mdash;Pearls are
prized the world over. It is a well-known fact that even in this country
pearls of some value are sometimes found within the shells of the
fresh-water mussel and the oyster. Most of the finest, however, come from
the waters around Ceylon. If a pearl is cut open and examined carefully, it
is found to be a deposit of the mother-of-pearl layer of the shell around
some central structure. It has been believed that any foreign substance, as
a grain of sand, might irritate the mantle at a given point, thus
stimulating it to secrete around the substance. It now seems likely that
most perfect pearls are due to the growth within the mantle of the clam or
oyster of certain parasites, stages in the development of a flukeworm. The
irritation thus set up in the tissue causes mother of pearl to be deposited
around the source of irritation, with the subsequent formation of a
pearl.</p>

<p class="smaller">The pearl-button industry in this country is largely
dependent upon the fresh-water mussel, the shells of which are used. This
mussel is being so rapidly depleted that the national government is working
out a means of artificial propagation of these animals.</p>

"fnanchor_29"></a><a href= "#footnote_29" class= "fnanchor">[29]</a> are
kept in hives. A colony consists of a queen, a female who lays the eggs for
the colony, the drones, whose duty it is to fertilize the eggs, and the
workers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px">

 <p class="caption">Cells of honeycomb, queen cell on right at bottom.</p>
</div>

<p>The cells of the comb are built by the workers out of wax secreted from
the under surface of their bodies. The wax is cut off in thin plates by
means of the wax shears between the two last joints of the hind legs. These
cells are used to place the eggs of the queen in, one egg to each cell, and
the young are hatched after three days, to begin life as footless white
grubs.</p>

<p>The young are fed for several days, then shut up in the cells and
allowed to form pupæ. Eventually they break their cells and take their
place as workers in the hive, first as nurses for the young and later as
pollen gatherers and honey makers.</p>

<p>We have already seen (pages <a href="#Page_37">37</a> to 39) that the
honeybee gathers nectar, which she swallows, keeping the fluid in her crop
until her return to the hive. Here it is forced out into cells of <a
name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>the
comb. It is now thinner than what we call honey. To thicken it, the bees
swarm over the open cells, moving their wings very rapidly, thus
evaporating some of the water. A hive of bees have been known to make over
thirty-one pounds of honey in a single day, although the average is very
much less than this. It is estimated from twenty to thirty millions of
dollars' worth of honey and wax are produced each year in this country.</p>

<p><b>Cochineal and Lac.</b>&mdash;Among other products of insect origin is
cochineal, a red coloring matter, which consists of the dried bodies of a
tiny insect, one of the plant lice which lives on the cactus plants in
Mexico and Central America. The lac insect, another one of the plant lice,
feeds on the juices of certain trees in India and pours out a substance
from its body which after treatment forms shellac. Shellac is of much use
as a basis for varnish.</p>

<p><b>Gall Insects.</b>&mdash;Oak galls, growths caused by the sting of
wasp-like insects, give us products used in ink making, in tanning, and in
making pyrogallic acid which is much used in developing photographs.</p>

<p><b>Insects destroy Harmful Plants or Animals.</b>&mdash;Some forms of
animal life are of great importance because of their destruction of harmful
plants or animals.</p>

</div>

<p>A near relative of the bee, called the ichneumon fly, does man
indirectly considerable good because of its habit of laying its eggs and
rearing the young in the bodies of caterpillars which are harmful to
vegetation. Some of the ichneumons even bore into trees in order to deposit
their eggs in the larvæ of wood-boring insects. It is safe to say that the
ichneumons save millions of dollars yearly to this country.</p>

<p>Several beetles are of value to man. Most important of these <a
name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>is
the natural enemy of the orange-tree scale, the ladybug, or ladybird
beetle. In New York state it may often be found feeding upon the plant
lice, or aphids, which live on rosebushes. The carrion beetles and many
water beetles act as scavengers. The sexton beetles bury dead carcasses of
animals. Ants in tropical countries are particularly useful as
scavengers.</p>

<p>Insects, besides pollinating flowers, often do a service by eating
harmful weeds. Thus many harmful plants are kept in check. We have noted
that they spin silk, thus forming clothing; that in many cases they are
preyed upon, and that they supply an enormous multitude of birds, fishes,
and other animals with food.</p>

 <p class="caption">The common toad, an insect eater.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Use of the Toad.</b>&mdash;The toad is of great economic importance
to man because of its diet. No less than eighty-three species of insects,
mostly injurious, have been proved to enter into the dietary. A toad has
been observed to snap up one hundred and twenty-eight flies in half an
hour. Thus at a low estimate it could easily destroy one hundred insects
during a day and do an immense service to the garden during the summer. It
has been estimated by Kirkland that a single toad may, on account of the
cutworms which it kills, be worth $19.88 each season it lives, if the
damage done by each cutworm be estimated at only one cent. Toads also feed
upon slugs and other garden pests.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Food of some common birds. Which of the above birds
 should be protected by man and why?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Birds eat Insects.</b>&mdash;The food of birds makes them of the
greatest economic importance to our country. This is because of the
relation of insects to agriculture. A large part of the diet of most of our
native birds includes insects harmful to vegetation. Investigations
undertaken by the United States Department of <a name="Page_210"
id="Page_210"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>Agriculture
(Division of Biological Survey) show that a surprisingly large number of
birds once believed to harm crops really perform a service by killing
injurious insects. Even the much maligned crow lives to some extent upon
insects. Swallows in the Southern states kill the cotton-boll weevil, one
of our worst insect pests. Our earliest visitor, the bluebird, subsists
largely on injurious insects, as do woodpeckers, cuckoos, kingbirds, and
many others. The robin, whose presence in the cherry tree we resent, during
the rest of the summer does much good by feeding upon noxious insects.
Birds use the food substances which are most abundant around them at the
time.<a name= "fnanchor_30" id= "fnanchor_30"></a><a href= "#footnote_30"
class= "fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><b>Birds eat Weed Seeds.</b>&mdash;Not only do birds aid man in his
battles with destructive insects, but seed-eating birds eat the seeds of
weeds. Our native sparrows (not the English sparrow), the mourning dove,
bobwhite, and other birds feed largely upon the seeds of many of our common
weeds. This fact alone is sufficient to make birds of vast economic
importance.</p>

<p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
211]</span> Not all birds are seed or insect feeders. Some, as the
cormorants, ospreys, gulls, and terns, are active fishers. Near large
cities gulls especially act as scavengers, destroying much floating garbage
that otherwise might be washed ashore to become a menace to health. The
vultures of India and semitropical countries are of immense value as
scavengers. Birds of prey (owls) eat living mammals, including many
rodents; for example, field mice, rats, and other pests.</p>

<p><b>Extermination of our Native Birds.</b>&mdash;Within our own times we
have witnessed the almost total extermination of some species of our native
birds. The American passenger pigeon, once very abundant in the Middle
West, is now extinct. Audubon, the greatest of all American bird lovers,
gives a graphic account of the migration of a flock of these birds. So
numerous were they that when the flock rose in the air the sun was
darkened, and at night the weight of the roosting birds broke down large
branches of the trees in which they rested. To-day not a single wild
specimen of this pigeon can be found, because they were slaughtered by the
hundreds of thousands during the breeding season. The wholesale killing of
the snowy egret to furnish ornaments for ladies' headwear is another
example of the improvidence of our fellow-countrymen. Charles Dudley Warner
said, "Feathers do not improve the appearance of an ugly woman, and a
pretty woman needs no such aid." Wholesale killing for plumage, eggs, and
food, and, alas, often for mere sport, has reduced the number of our birds
more than one half in thirty states and territories within the past fifteen
years. Every crusade against indiscriminate killing of our native birds
should be welcomed by all thinking <a name="Page_212"
id="Page_212"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>Americans. The
recent McLane bill which aims at the protection of migrating birds and the
bird-protecting clause of the recently passed tariff bill shows that this
country is awaking to the value of her bird life. Without the birds the
farmer would have a hopeless fight against insect pests. The effect of
killing native birds is now well seen in Italy and Japan, where insects are
increasing and do greater damage each year to crops and trees.</p>

<p>Of the eight hundred or more species of birds in the United States, only
six species of hawks (Cooper's and the sharp-shinned hawk in particular),
and the great horned owl, which prey upon useful birds; the sapsucker,
which kills or injures many trees because of its fondness for the growing
layer of the tree; the bobolink, which destroys yearly $2,000,000 worth of
rice in the South; the crow, which feeds on crops as well as insects; and
the English sparrow, may be considered as enemies of man.</p>

<p><b>The English Sparrow.</b>&mdash;The English sparrow is an example of a
bird introduced for the purpose of insect destruction, that has done great
harm because of its relation to our native birds. Introduced at Brooklyn in
1850 for the purpose of exterminating the cankerworm, it soon abandoned an
insect diet and has driven out most of our native insect feeders.
Investigations by the United States Department of Agriculture have shown
that in the country these birds and their young feed to a large extent upon
grain, thus showing them to be injurious to agriculture. Dirty and very
prolific, it already has worked its way from the East as far as the Pacific
coast. In this area the bluebird, song sparrow, and yellowbird have all
been forced to give way, as well as many larger birds of great economic
value and beauty. The English sparrow has become a pest especially in our
cities, and should be exterminated in order to save our native birds. It is
feared in some quarters that the English starling which has recently been
introduced into this country may in time prove a pest as formidable as the
English sparrow.</p>

 <p class="captionj">This shows how some snakes (constrictors) kill and eat
 their prey. (Series photographed by C. W. Beebe and Clarence Halter.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Food of Snakes.</b>&mdash;Probably the most disliked and feared of
all animals are the snakes. This feeling, however, is rarely deserved, for,
on the whole, our common snakes are beneficial to man. The black snake and
the milk snake feed largely on injurious rodents <a name="Page_213"
id="Page_213"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>(rats, mice, etc.),
the pretty green snake eats injurious insects, and the little DeKay snake
feeds partially on slugs. If it were not that the rattlesnake and the
copperhead are venomous, they also could be said to be useful, for they
live on English sparrows, rats, mice, moles, and rabbits.</p>

<p><b>Food of Herbivorous Animals.</b>&mdash;We must not forget that other
animals besides insects and birds help to keep down the rapidly growing
weeds. Herbivorous animals the world over destroy, besides the grass which
they eat, untold multitudes of weeds, which, if unchecked, would drive out
the useful occupants of the pasture, the grasses and grains.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">harm done by animals</span></p>

<p><b>Economic Loss from Insects.</b>&mdash;The money value of crops,
forest trees, stored foods, and other material destroyed annually by
insects is beyond belief. It is estimated that they get one tenth of the
country's crops, at the lowest estimate a matter of some $300,000,000
yearly. "The common schools of the country cost in 1902 the sum of
$235,000,000, and all higher <a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>institutions of learning cost less than
$50,000,000, making the total cost of education in the United States
considerably less than the farmers lost from insect ravages.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Furthermore, the yearly losses from insect ravages aggregate nearly
twice as much as it costs to maintain our army and navy; more than twice
the loss by fire; twice the capital invested in manufacturing agricultural
implements; and nearly three times the estimated value of the products of
all the fruit orchards, vineyards, and small fruit farms in the
country."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Slingerland.</span></p>

<p>The total yearly value of all farm and forest products in New York is
perhaps $150,000,000, and the one tenth that the insects get is worth
$15,000,000.</p>

<p><b>Insects which damage Garden and Other Crops.</b>&mdash;The
grasshoppers and the larvæ of various moths do considerable harm here,
especially the "cabbage worm," the cutworm, a feeder on all kinds of garden
truck, and the corn worm, a pest on corn, cotton, tomatoes, peas, and
beans.</p>

<p>Among the beetles which are found in gardens is the potato beetle, which
destroys the potato plant. This beetle formerly lived in Mexico upon a wild
plant of the same family as the potato, and came north upon the
introduction of the potato into Colorado, evidently preferring cultivated
forms to wild forms of this family.</p>

</div>

<p>The one beetle doing by far the greatest harm in this country is the
cotton-boll weevil. Imported from Mexico, since 1892 it has spread over
eastern Texas and into Louisiana. The beetle lays its eggs in the young
cotton fruit or boll, and the larvæ feed upon <a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>the substance within
the boll. It is estimated that if unchecked this pest would destroy yearly
one half of the cotton crop, causing a loss of $250,000,000. Fortunately,
the United States Department of Agriculture is at work on the problem, and,
while it has not found any way of exterminating the beetle as yet, it has
been found that, by planting more hardy varieties of cotton, the crop
matures earlier and ripens before the weevils have increased in sufficient
numbers to destroy the crop (see page <a href="#Page_126">126</a>).</p>

<p>The bugs are among our most destructive insects. The most familiar
examples of our garden pests are the squash bug; the chinch bug, which
yearly does damage estimated at $20,000,000, by sucking the juice from the
leaves of grain; and the plant lice, or aphids. One, living on the grape,
yearly destroys immense numbers of vines in the vineyards of France,
Germany, and California.</p>

<p><b>Insects which harm Fruit and Forest Trees.</b>&mdash;Great damage is
annually done trees by the larvæ of moths. Massachusetts has already spent
over $3,000,000 in trying to exterminate the imported gypsy moth. The
codling moth, which bores into apples and pears, is estimated to ruin
yearly $3,000,000 worth of fruit in New York alone, which is by no means
the most important apple region of the United States. Among these pests,
the most important to the dweller in a large city is the tussock moth,
which destroys our shade trees. The caterpillar may easily be recognized by
its hairy, <a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
216]</span>tufted red head. The eggs are laid on the bark of shade trees in
what look like masses of foam. (See figure on page <a
href="#Page_215">215</a>.) By collecting and burning the egg masses in the
fall, we may save many shade trees the following year.</p>

<p>The larvæ of some moths damage the trees by boring into the wood of the
tree on which they live. Such are the peach, apple, and other fruit-tree
borers common in our orchards. Many beetle larvæ also live in trees and
kill annually thousands of forest and shade trees. The hickory borer
threatens to kill all the hickory trees in the Eastern states.</p>

<p>Among the bugs most destructive to trees are the scale insect and the
plant lice. The San José scale, a native of China, was introduced into the
fruit groves of California about 1870 and has spread all over the country.
A ladybird beetle, which has also been imported, is the most effective
agent in keeping this pest in check.</p>

<p><b>Insects of the House or Storehouse.</b>&mdash;Weevils are the
greatest pests, frequently ruining tons of stored corn, wheat, and other
cereals. Roaches will eat almost anything, even clothing; they are
especially fond of all kinds of breadstuffs. The carpet beetle is a
recognized foe of the housekeeper, the larvæ feeding upon all sorts of
woolen material. The larvæ of the clothes moth do an immense amount of
damage, especially to stored clothing. Fleas, lice, and particularly
bedbugs are among man's personal foes. Besides being unpleasant they are
believed to be disease carriers and as such should be exterminated.<a name=

<p class="smaller"><b>Food of Starfish.</b>&mdash;Starfish are enormously
destructive to young clams and oysters, as the following evidence,
collected by Professor A. D. Mead, of Brown University, shows. A single
starfish was confined in an aquarium with fifty-six young clams. The
largest clam was about the length of one arm of the starfish, the smallest
about ten millimeters in length. In six days every clam in the aquarium was
devoured. Hundreds of thousands of dollars' damage is done annually to the
oysters in Connecticut alone by the ravages of starfish. During the
breeding season of the clam and oyster the boats dredge up tons of starfish
which are thrown on shore to die or to be used as fertilizer.</p>

 <p class="captionj">The life history of the malarial parasite. This cut of
 the malarial parasite shows parts of the body of the mosquito and of man.
 To understand the life history begin at the point where the mosquito
 injects the crescent-shaped bodies into the blood of man. Notice that
 after the spores are released from the corpuscles of man two kinds of
 cells <i>may be formed</i>. These are probably a sexual stage. Development
 within the body of the mosquito will only take place when the parasite is
 taken into its body at this sexual stage.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Cause of Malaria.</b>&mdash;The study of the life history and
habits of the Protozoa has resulted in the finding of many parasitic forms,
and the consequent explanation of some kinds of disease. One parasitic
protozoan like an am&oelig;ba is called <i>Plasmodium malariæ</i>. It
causes the disease known as malaria. When a mosquito (the <i>anopheles</i>)
sucks the blood from a person having malaria this parasite passes into the
stomach of the mosquito. After completing a part of its life history within
the mosquito's body the parasite establishes itself within the glands which
secrete the saliva of the mosquito. After about eight days, if the infected
mosquito bites a person, some of the parasites are introduced into the
blood along with the saliva. These parasites enter the corpuscles of the
blood, increase in size, and then form spores. The rapid process of spore
formation results in the breaking down of the blood corpuscles and the
release of the spores, and the <a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span>poisons they manufacture, into the blood.
This causes the chill followed by the fever so characteristic of malaria.
The spores may again enter the blood corpuscles and in forty-eight or
seventy-two hours repeat the process thus described, depending on the kind
of malaria they cause. The only cure for the disease is <i>quinine</i> in
rather large doses. This kills the parasites in the blood. But quinine
should not be taken except under a physician's directions.</p>

 (<i>culex</i>), <i>a</i>, from the malarial mosquito (<i>anopheles</i>),

</div>

<p><b>The Malarial Mosquito.</b>&mdash;Fortunately for mankind, not all
mosquitoes harbor the parasite which causes malaria. The harmless mosquito
(<i>culex</i>) may be usually distinguished from the mosquito which carries
malaria (<i>anopheles</i>) by the position taken when at rest. Culex lays
eggs in tiny rafts of one hundred or more eggs in any standing water; thus
the eggs are distinguished from those of anopheles, which are not in rafts.
Rain barrels, gutters, or old cans may breed in a short time enough
mosquitoes to stock a neighborhood. The larvæ are known as wigglers. They
breathe through a tube in the posterior end of the body, and may be
recognized by their peculiar movement when on their way to the surface to
breathe. The pupa, distinguished by a large thoracic region, breathes
through a pair of tubes on the thorax. The fact that both larvæ and pupæ
take air from the surface of the water makes it possible to kill the
mosquito during these stages by pouring oil on the surface of the water
where they breed. The introduction of minnows, gold fish, or other small
fish which feed <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span>upon the larvæ in the water where the
mosquitoes breed will do much to free a neighborhood from this pest.
Draining swamps or low land which holds water after a rain is another
method of extermination. Some of the mosquito-infested districts around New
York City have been almost freed from mosquitoes by draining the salt
marshes where they breed. Long shallow trenches are so built as to tap and
drain off any standing water in which the eggs might be laid. In this way
the mosquito has been almost exterminated along some parts of our New
England coast.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of historical times, malaria has been prevalent in
regions infested by mosquitoes. The ancient city of Rome was so greatly
troubled by periodic outbreaks of malarial fever that a goddess of fever
came to be worshiped in order to lessen the severity of what the
inhabitants believed to be a divine visitation. At the present time the
malaria of Italy is being successfully fought and conquered by the draining
of the mosquito-breeding marshes. By a little carefully directed oiling of
water a few boys may make an almost uninhabitable region absolutely safe to
live in. Why not try it if there are mosquitoes in your neighborhood?</p>

<p><b>Yellow Fever and Mosquitoes.</b>&mdash;Another disease carried by
mosquitoes is yellow fever. In the year 1878 there were 125,000 cases and
12,000 deaths in the United States, mostly in Alabama, Louisiana, and
Mississippi. During the French occupation of the Panama Canal zone the work
was at a standstill part of the time because of the ravages of yellow
fever. Before the war with Spain thousands of people were ill in Cuba. But
to-day this is changed, and yellow fever is under almost complete control,
both here and <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>in the Canal zone, where the mosquito
(<i>stegomyia</i>) which carries yellow fever exists.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Notice the difference in the number of yearly deaths
 from yellow fever before and <i>after</i> the American occupation of
 Havana.</p>
</div>

<p>This is due to the experiments during the summer of 1900 of a Commission
of United States army officers, headed by Dr. Walter Reed. Of these men
one, Dr. Jesse Lazear, gave up his life to prove experimentally that yellow
fever was caused by mosquitoes. He allowed himself to be bitten by a
mosquito that was known to have bitten a yellow fever patient, contracted
the disease, and died a martyr to science. Others, soldiers, volunteered to
further test by experiment how the disease was spread, so that in the end
Dr. Reed was able to prove to the world that if mosquitoes could be
prevented from biting people who had yellow fever the disease could not be
spread. The accompanying illustration shows the result of this knowledge
for the city of Havana. For years Havana was considered one of the pest
spots of the West Indies. Visitors shunned this port and commerce was much
affected by the constant menace of <a name="Page_221"
id="Page_221"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>yellow fever. At the
time of the American occupation after the war with Spain, the experiments
referred to above were undertaken. The city was cleaned up, proper
sanitation introduced, screens placed in most buildings, and the breeding
places of the mosquitoes were so nearly destroyed that the city was
practically free from mosquitoes. The result, so far as yellow fever was
concerned, was startling, as you can see by reference to the chart. Notice
also the rise in the death rate when the young Cuban Republic took control.
How do you account for that? We all know what American scientific medicine
and sanitation is doing in Panama and in the Philippines.</p>

<p><b>Other Protozoan Diseases.</b>&mdash;Many other diseases of man are
probably caused by parasitic protozoans. Dysentery of one kind appears to
be caused by the presence of an am&oelig;ba-like animal in the digestive
tract which comes usually through an impure water supply. Smallpox, rabies,
and possibly other diseases are caused by protozoans. Smallpox, which was
once the most dreaded disease known to man, because of its spread in
epidemics, has been conquered by <i>vaccination</i>, of which we shall
learn more later. The death rate from rabies or hydrophobia has in a like
manner been greatly reduced by a treatment founded on the same principles
as vaccination and invented by Louis Pasteur.</p>

<p>Another group of protozoan parasites are called <i>trypanosomes</i>.
These are parasitic in insects, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in
various parts of the world. They cause various diseases of cattle and other
domestic animals, being carried to the animal in most cases by flies. One
of this family is believed to live in the blood of native African zebras
and antelopes; seemingly it does them no harm. But if one of these
parasites is transferred by the dreaded tsetse fly to one of the
domesticated horses or cattle of the colonist of that region, death of the
animal results.</p>

<p><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
222]</span> Another fly carries a species of trypanosome to the natives of
Central Africa, which causes "the dreaded and incurable sleeping sickness."
This disease carries off more than fifty thousand natives yearly, and many
Europeans have succumbed to it. Its ravages are now largely confined to an
area near the large Central African lakes and the Upper Nile, for the fly
which carries the disease lives near water, seldom going more than 150 feet
from the banks of streams or lakes. The British government is now trying to
control the disease in Uganda by moving all the villages at least two miles
from the lakes and rivers. Among other diseases that may be due to
protozoans is kala-agar, a fever in hot Asiatic countries which is probably
carried by the bedbug, and African tick fever, probably carried by a small
insect called the tick. Bubonic plague, one of the most dreaded of all
infectious diseases, is carried to man by fleas from rats. In this country
many fatal diseases of cattle, as "tick," or Texas cattle fever, are
probably caused by protozoans.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Fly a Disease Carrier.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that
mosquitoes of different species carry malaria and yellow fever. Another
rather recent addition to the black list is the house fly or typhoid fly.
We shall see later with what reason this name is given. The development of
the typhoid fly is extremely rapid. A female may lay from one hundred to
two hundred eggs. These are usually deposited in filth or manure. Dung
heaps <a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
223]</span>about stables, privy vaults, ash heaps, uncared-for garbage
cans, and fermenting vegetable refuse form the best breeding places for
flies. In warm weather, the eggs hatch a day or so after they are laid and
become larvæ, called maggots. After about one week of active feeding, these
wormlike maggots become quiet and go into the pupal stage, whence under
favorable conditions they emerge within less than another week as adult
flies. The adults breed at once, and in a short summer there may be over
ten generations of flies. This accounts for the great number. Fortunately
relatively few flies survive the winter. The membranous wings of the adult
fly appear to be two in number, a second pair being reduced to tiny knobbed
hairs called balancers. The head is freely movable, with large compound
eyes. The mouth parts form a proboscis, which is tonguelike, the animal
obtaining its food by lapping and sucking. The foot shows a wonderful
adaptation for clinging to smooth surfaces. Two or three pads, each of
which bears tubelike hairs that secrete a sticky fluid, are found on its
under surface. It is by this means that the fly is able to walk upside
down, and carry bacteria on its feet.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The&nbsp;Typhoid&nbsp;Fly a Pest.</b>&mdash;The common fly is
recognized as a pest the world over. Flies have long been known to spoil
food through their filthy habits, but it is more recently that the very
serious charge of spread of diseases, caused by bacteria, has <a
name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>been
laid at their door. In a recent experiment two young men from the
Connecticut Agricultural Station found that a single fly might carry on its
feet anywhere from 500 to 6,600,000 bacteria, the average number being over
1,200,000. Not all of these germs are harmful, but they might easily
include those of typhoid fever, tuberculosis, summer complaint, and
possibly other diseases. A recent pamphlet published by the Merchants'
Association in New York City shows that the rapid increase of flies during
the summer months has a definite correlation with the increase in the
number of cases of summer complaint. Observations in other cities seem to
show the increase in number of typhoid cases in the early fall is due, in
part at least, to the same cause. A terrible toll of disease and death may
be laid at the door of the typhoid fly.</p>

 outdoor toilets were made fly proof during winter of 1910. Account for the
 decrease in typhoid after the flies were kept out of the toilets.</p>
</div>

<p>Recently the stable fly has been found to carry the dread disease known
as infantile paralysis.</p>

<p><b>Remedies.</b>&mdash;Cleanliness which destroys the breeding place of
flies, the frequent removal and destruction of garbage, rubbish, and
manure, covering of all food when not in use and especially the
<i>careful</i> screening of windows and doors during the breeding <a
name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
225]</span>season, will all play a part in the reduction of flies. To the
motto "swat the fly" should be added, "remove their breeding places!"</p>

<p><b>Other Insect Disease Carriers.</b>&mdash;Fleas and bedbugs have been
recently added to those insects proven to carry disease to man. Bubonic
plague, which is primarily a disease of rats, is undoubtedly transmitted
from the infected rats to man by the fleas. Fleas are also believed to
transmit leprosy although this is not proven.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 170px">
 <img src="images/i229.jpg"
 width="167" height="98"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Flea which transmits Bubonic plague from rat to
 man.</p>
</div>

<p>To rid a house of fleas we must first find their breeding places. Old
carpets, the sleeping places of cats or dogs or any dirty unswept corner
may hold the eggs of the flea. The young breed in cracks and crevices,
feeding upon organic matter there. Eventually they come to live as adults
on their warm-blooded hosts, cats, dogs, or man. Evidently destruction of
the breeding places, careful washing of all infected areas, the use of
benzine or gasoline in crevices where the larvæ may be hid are the most
effective methods of extermination. Pets which might harbor fleas should be
washed frequently with a weak (two to three per cent) solution of
creolin.</p>

<p>Bedbugs are difficult to prove as an agent in the transmission of
disease but their disgusting habits are sufficient reason for their
extermination. It has been proven by experiment that they may spread
typhoid and relapsing fevers. They prefer human blood to other food and
have come to live in bedrooms and beds because this food can be obtained
there. They are extremely difficult to exterminate because their flat body
allows them to hide in cracks out of sight. Wooden beds are thus better
protection for them than iron or brass beds. Boiling water poured over the
cracks when they breed or a mixture of strong corrosive sublimate four
parts, alcohol four parts and spirits of turpentine one part, are effective
remedies.</p>

<p><b>How the Harm done by Insects is Controlled.</b>&mdash;The combating
of insects is directed by several bodies of men, all of which have the same
end in view. These are the Bureau of Entomology of the United States
Department of Agriculture, <a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>the various state experiment stations, and
medical and civic organizations.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Entomology works in harmony with the other divisions of
the Department of Agriculture, giving the time of its experts to the
problems of controlling insects which, for good or ill, influence man's
welfare in this country. The destruction of the malarial mosquito and
control of the typhoid fly; the destruction of harmful insects by the
introduction of their natural enemies, plant or animal; the perfecting of
the honeybee (see Hodge, <i>Nature Study and Life</i>, page 240), and the
introduction of new species of insects to pollinate flowers not native to
this country (see <i>Blastophaga</i>, page 43), are some of the problems to
which these men are now devoting their time.</p>

<p>All the states and territories have, since 1888, established state
experiment stations, which work in coöperation with the government in the
war upon injurious insects. These stations are often connected with
colleges, so that young men who are interested in this kind of natural
science may have opportunity to learn and to help.</p>

<p>The good done by these means directly and indirectly is very great.
Bulletins are published by the various state stations and by the Department
of Agriculture, most of which may be obtained free. The most interesting of
these from the high school standpoint are the Farmers' Bulletins, issued by
the Department of Agriculture, and the Nature Study pamphlets issued by the
Cornell University in New York state.</p>

 <p class="captionj"> This diagram shows how bubonic plague is carried to

</div>

<p><b>Animals Other than Insects may be Disease Carriers.</b>&mdash;The
common brown rat is an example of a mammal, harmful to civilized man, which
has followed in his footsteps all over the world. Starting from China, it
spread to eastern Europe, thence to western Europe, and in 1775 it had
obtained a lodgment in this country. In seventy-five years it reached the
Pacific coast, and is now fairly common all over the United States, being
one of the most prolific <a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>of all mammals. Rats are believed to carry
bubonic plague, the "Black Death" of the Middle Ages, a disease estimated
to have killed 25,000,000 people during the fourteenth century. The rat,
like man, is susceptible to plague; fleas bite the rat and then biting man
transmit the disease to him. A determined effort is now being made to
exterminate the rat because of its connection with bubonic plague.</p>

<p><b>Other Parasitic Animals cause Disease.</b>&mdash;Besides parasitic
protozoans other forms of animals have been found that <i>cause</i>
disease. Chief among these are certain round and flat worms, which have
come to live as parasites on man and other animals. A one-sided
relationship has thus come into existence where the worm receives its
living from the host, as the animal is called on which the parasite lives.
Consequently the parasite frequently becomes fastened to its host during
adult life and often is reduced to a mere bag through which the fluid food
prepared by its host is absorbed. Sometimes a complicated life history has
arisen from their parasitic habits. Such is seen in the life history of the
liver fluke, a flatworm which kills sheep, and in the tapeworm.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">The life cycle of a tapeworm. (1) The eggs are taken
 in with filthy food by the pig; (2) man eats undercooked pork by means of
 which the bladder worm (3) is transferred to his own intestine (4).</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cestodes or Tapeworms.</b>&mdash;These parasites infest man and many
other vertebrate animals. The tapeworm (<i>Tænia solium</i>) passes through
two stages in its life history, the first within a pig, the second within
the intestine of man. The developing eggs are passed off with wastes from
the intestine of man. The pig, an animal with dirty habits, may take in the
worm embryos with its food. The worm develops within the intestine of the
pig, but soon makes its way into the muscle or other tissues. It is here
known as a bladderworm. If man eats raw or undercooked pork containing
these worms, <i>he</i> may become a host for the tapeworm. Thus during its
complete life history it has two hosts. Another common tapeworm parasitic
on man lives part of its life as an embryo within the muscles of cattle.
The adult worm consists <a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>of a round headlike part provided with
hooks, by means of which it fastens itself to the wall of the intestine.
This head now buds off a series of segmentlike structures, which are
practically bags full of sperms and eggs. These structures, called
<i>proglottids</i>, break off from time to time, thus allowing the
developing eggs to escape. The proglottids have no separate digestive
systems, but the whole body surface, bathed in digested food, absorbs it
and is thus enabled to grow rapidly.</p>

 <p class="captionj"><i>Trichinella spiralis</i> imbedded in human muscle.
 (After Leuckart.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Roundworms.</b>&mdash;Still other wormlike creatures called
roundworms are of importance to man. Some, as the vinegar eel found in
vinegar, or the pinworms parasitic in the lower intestine, particularly of
children, do little or no harm. The pork worm or <i>trichina</i>, however,
is a parasite which may cause serious injury. It passes through the first
part of its existence as a parasite in a pig or other vertebrate (cat, rat,
or rabbit), where it lies, covered within a tiny sac or <i>cyst</i>, in the
muscles of its hosts. If raw pork containing these worms is eaten by man,
the cyst is dissolved off by the action of the digestive fluids, and the
living trichina becomes free in the intestine of man. Here it reproduces
and the young bore their way through the intestine walls and enter the
muscles, causing inflammation there. This causes a painful and often fatal
disease known as <i>trichinosis</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Hookworm.</b>&mdash;The discovery by Dr. C. W. Stiles of the
Bureau of Animal Industry, that the laziness and shiftlessness of the "poor
whites" of the South is partly due to a parasite called the
<i>hookworm</i>, reads like a fairy tale.</p>

<p>The people, largely farmers, become infected with a larval stage of the
hookworm, which develops in moist earth. It enters the body usually through
the skin of the feet, for children and adults alike, in certain localities
where the disease is common, go barefoot to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>A complicated journey from the skin to the intestine now follows, <a
name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>the
larvæ passing through the veins to the heart, from there to the lungs; here
they bore into the air passages and eventually work their way by way of the
windpipe into the intestine. One result of the injury of the lungs is that
many thus infected are subject to tuberculosis. The adult worms, once in
the food tube, fasten themselves and feed upon the blood of their host by
puncturing the intestine wall. The loss of blood from this cause is not
sufficient to account for the bloodlessness of the person infected, but it
has been discovered that the hookworm pours out a poison into the wound
which prevents the blood from clotting rapidly (see page <a
href="#Page_315">315</a>); hence a considerable loss of blood occurs from
the wound after the worm has finished its meal and gone to another part of
the intestine.</p>

 <p class="caption">A family suffering from hookworm.</p>
</div>

<p>The cure of the disease is very easy; thymol is given, which weakens the
hold of the worm, this being followed by Epsom salts. For years a large
area in the South undoubtedly has been retarded in its development by this
parasite; hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of lives have been
needlessly sacrificed.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span> "The hookworm is not a bit spectacular: it
doesn't get itself discussed in legislative halls or furiously debated in
political campaigns. Modest and unassuming, it does not aspire to such
dignity. It is satisfied simply with (1) lowering the working efficiency
and the pleasure of living in something like two hundred thousand persons
in Georgia and all other Southern states in proportion; with (2) amassing a
death rate higher than tuberculosis, pneumonia, or typhoid fever; with (3)
stubbornly and quite effectually retarding the agricultural and industrial
development of the section; with (4) nullifying the benefit of thousands of
dollars spent upon education; with (5) costing the South, in the course of
a few decades, several hundred millions of dollars. More serious and closer
at hand than the tariff; more costly, threatening, and tangible than the
Negro problem; making the menace of the boll weevil laughable in
comparison&mdash;it is preëminently the problem of the
South."&mdash;<i>Atlanta Constitution.</i></p>

<p><b>Animals that prey upon Man.</b>&mdash;The toll of death from animals
which prey upon or harm man directly is relatively small. Snakes in
tropical countries kill many cattle and not a few people.</p>

<p class="smaller">The bite of the rattlesnake of our own country, although
dangerous, seldom kills. The dreaded cobra of India has a record of over
two hundred and fifty thousand persons killed in the last thirty-five
years. The Indian government yearly pays out large sums for the
extermination of venomous snakes, over two hundred thousand of which have
been killed during a single year.</p>

seek their prey chiefly at night, and spend the day basking in the sun. The

hundred lives from the natives.</p>

<p>Carnivorous animals such as lions and tigers still inflict damage in
certain parts of the world, but as the tide of civilization advances, <a

<a href="#fnanchor_30">[30]</a>
 The following quotation from I. P. Trimble, <i>A Treatise on the Insect
 Enemies of Fruit and Shade Trees</i>, bears out this statement: "On the
 fifth of May, 1864, ... seven different birds ... had been feeding freely
 upon small beetles.... There was a great flight of beetles that day; the
 atmosphere was teeming with them. A few days after, the air was filled
 with Ephemera flies, and the same species of birds were then feeding upon
 them."</p>

<p class="footnote">During the outbreak of Rocky Mountain locusts in
Nebraska in 1874-1877, Professor Samuel Aughey saw a long-billed marsh wren
carry thirty locusts to her young in an hour. At this rate, for seven hours
a day, a brood would consume 210 locusts per day, and the passerine birds
of the eastern half of Nebraska, allowing only twenty broods to the square
mile, would destroy daily 162,771,000 of the pests. The average locust
weighs about fifteen grains, and is capable each day of consuming its own
weight of standing forage crops, which at $10 per ton would be worth
$1743.26. This case may serve as an illustration of the vast good that is
done every year by the destruction of insect pests fed to nestling birds.
And it should be remembered that the nesting season is also that when the
destruction of injurious insects is most needed; that is, at the period of
greatest agricultural activity and before the parasitic insects can be
depended on to reduce the pests. The encouragement of birds to nest on the
farm and the discouragement of nest robbing are therefore more than mere
matters of sentiment; they return an actual cash equivalent, and have a
definite bearing on the success or failure of the crops.<span

<p><b>The Body.</b>&mdash;One of our common fresh-water fish is
the bream, or golden shiner. The body of the bream runs insensibly into the
head, the neck being absent. The long, narrow body with its smooth surface
fits the fish admirably for its life in the water. Certain cells in the
skin secrete mucus or slime, another adaptation. <a name="Page_233"
id="Page_233"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>The position of the
scales, overlapping in a backward direction, is yet another adaptation
which aids in passing through the water. Its color, olive above and bright
silver and gold below, is protective. Can you see how?</p>

 <p class="caption">The bream. <i>A</i>, dorsal fin; <i>B</i>, caudal fin;
 <i>C</i>, anal fin; <i>D</i>, pelvic fin; <i>E</i>, pectoral fin.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Appendages and their Uses.</b>&mdash;The appendages of the fish
consist of paired and unpaired fins. The paired fins are four in number,
and are believed to correspond in position and structure with the paired
limbs of a man. Note the illustration above and locate the paired
<i>pectoral</i> and <i>pelvic</i> fins. (These are so called because they
are attached to the bones forming the pectoral and pelvic girdles. See page
<a href="#Page_268">268</a>.) Find, by comparison with the Figure, the
<i>dorsal</i>, <i>anal</i>, and <i>caudal</i> fins. How many unpaired fins
are there?</p>

<p>The flattened, muscular body of the fish, tapering toward the caudal
fin, is moved from side to side with an undulating motion which results in
the forward movement of the fish. This movement is almost identical with
that of an oar in sculling a boat. Turning movements are brought about by
use of the lateral fins in much the same way as a boat is turned. We notice
the dorsal and other single fins are evidently useful in balancing and
steering.</p>

<p><b>The Senses.</b>&mdash;The position of the eyes at the side of the
head is an evident advantage to the fish. Why? The eye is globular <a
name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>in
shape. Such an eye has been found to be very nearsighted. Thus it is
unlikely that a fish is able to perceive objects at any great distance from
it. The eyes are unprotected by eyelids, but the tough outer covering and
their position afford some protection.</p>

<p>Feeding experiments with fishes show that a fish becomes aware of the
presence of food by smelling it as well as by seeing it. The nostrils of a
fish can be proved to end in little pits, one under each nostril hole. Thus
they differ from our own, which are connected with the mouth cavity. In the
catfish, for example, the <i>barbels</i>, or horns, receive sensations of
smell and taste. They do not perceive odors as we do for a fish perceives
only substances that are dissolved in the water in which it lives. The
senses of taste and touch appear to be less developed than the other
senses.</p>

<p>Along each side of most fishes is a line of tiny pits, provided with
sense organs and connected with the central nervous system of the fish.
This area, called the <i>lateral line</i>, is believed to be sensitive to
mechanical stimuli of certain sorts. The "ear" of the fish is under the
skin and serves partly as a balancing organ.</p>

<p><b>Food Getting.</b>&mdash;A fish must go after its food and seize it,
but has no structures for grasping except the teeth. Consequently we find
the teeth small, sharp, and numerous, well adapted for holding living prey.
The tongue in most fishes is wanting or very slightly developed.</p>

<p><b>Breathing.</b>&mdash;A fish, when swimming quietly or when at rest,
seems to be biting when no food is present. A reason for this act is to be
seen when we introduce a little finely powdered carmine into the water near
the head of the fish. It will be found that a current of water enters the
mouth at each of these biting movements and passes out through two slits
found on each side of the head of the fish. Investigation shows us that
under the broad, flat plate, or <i>operculum</i>, forming each side of the
head, lie several long, feathery, red structures, the <i>gills</i>.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Diagram of the gills of a fish. (<i>H</i>), the heart
 which forces the blood into the tubes (<i>V</i>), which run out into the
 gill filaments. A gill bar (<i>G</i>) supports each gill. The blood after
 exchanging its carbon dioxide for oxygen is sent out to the cells of the
 body through the artery (<i>A</i>).</p>
</div>

<p><b>Gills.</b>&mdash;If we examine the gills of any large fish, we find
that a single gill is held in place by a bony arch, made of several pieces
of bone which are hinged in such a way as to give great flexibility to the
gill arch, as the support is called. Covering the bony framework, and
extending from it, are numerous delicate filaments <a name="Page_235"
id="Page_235"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>covered with a very
thin membrane or skin. Into each of these filaments pass two blood vessels;
in one blood flows downward and in the other upward. Blood reaches the
gills and is carried away from these organs by means of two large vessels
which pass along the bony arch previously mentioned. In the gill filament
the blood comes into contact with the free oxygen of the water bathing the
gills. An exchange of gases through the walls of the gill filaments results
in the loss of carbon dioxide and a gain of oxygen by the blood. The blood
carries oxygen to the cells of the body and (as work is done by the cells
as a result of the oxidation of food) brings carbon dioxide back to the
gills.</p>

<p><b>Gill Rakers.</b>&mdash;If we open wide the mouth of any large fish
and look inward, we find that the mouth cavity leads to a funnel-like
opening, the gullet. On each side of the gullet we can see the gill arches,
guarded on the inner side by a series of sharp-pointed structures, the
<i>gill rakers</i>. In some fishes in which the teeth are not well
developed, there seems to be a greater development of the gill rakers,
which in this case are used to strain out small organisms from the water
which passes over the gills. Many fishes make such use of the gill rakers.
Such are the shad and menhaden, which feed almost entirely on
<i>plankton</i>, a name given to the small plants and animals found by
millions in the water.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Digestive System.</b>&mdash;The gullet leads directly
into a baglike stomach. There are no salivary glands in the fishes. There
is, however, a large liver, which appears to be used as a digestive gland.
This organ, because of the oil it contains, is in some fishes, as the cod,
of considerable economic importance. Many fishes have outgrowths like a
series of pockets from the intestine. These structures, called the
<i>pyloric cæca</i>, are believed to <a name="Page_236"
id="Page_236"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span> secrete a digestive
fluid. The intestine ends at the vent, which is usually located on the
under side of the fish, immediately in front of the anal fin.</p>

 the gills; <i>L</i>, the liver; <i>S</i>, the stomach; <i>I</i>, the
 intestine; <i>O</i>, the ovary; <i>K</i>, the kidney, and <i>B</i>, the
 air bladder.</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller"><b>Swim Bladder.</b>&mdash;An organ of unusual
significance, called the <i>swim bladder</i>, occupies the region just
dorsal to the food tube. In young fishes of many species this is connected
by a tube with the anterior end of the digestive tract. In some forms this
tube persists throughout life, but in other fishes it becomes closed, a
thin, fibrous cord taking its place. The swim bladder aids in giving the
fish nearly the same weight as the water it displaces, thus buoying it up.
The walls of the organ are richly supplied with blood vessels, and it thus
undoubtedly serves as an organ for supplying oxygen to the blood when all
other sources fail. In some fishes (the <i>dipnoi</i>, page <a
href="#Page_187">187</a>) it has come to be used as a lung.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Circulation of the Blood.</b>&mdash;In the vertebrate
animals the blood is said to circulate in the body, because it passes
through a more or less closed system of tubes in its course around the
body. In the fishes the heart is a two-chambered muscular organ, a
thin-walled <i>auricle</i>, the receiving chamber, leading into a
thick-walled muscular <i>ventricle</i> from which the blood is forced out.
The blood is pumped from the heart to the gills; there it loses some of its
carbon dioxide; it then passes on to other parts of the body, eventually
breaking up into very tiny tubes called <i>capillaries</i>. From the
capillaries the blood returns, in tubes of gradually increasing diameter,
toward the heart again. The body cells lie between the smallest branches of
the capillaries. Thus they get from the blood food and oxygen and return to
the blood the wastes resulting from oxidation within the cell body. During
its course some of the blood passes through the kidneys and is there
relieved of part of its nitrogenous waste. Circulation <a name="Page_237"
id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span> of blood in the
body of the fish is rather slow. The temperature of the blood being nearly
that of the surrounding media in which the fish lives, the animal has
incorrectly been given the term "cold-blooded."</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;As in all other vertebrate
animals, the brain and spinal cord of the fish are partially inclosed in
bone. The central nervous system consists of a <i>brain</i>, with nerves
connecting the organs of sight, taste, smell, and hearing, and such parts
of the body as possess the sense of touch; a <i>spinal cord</i>; and
<i>spinal nerves</i>. Nerve cells located near the outside of the body send
in messages to the central system, which are there received as sensations.
Cells of the central nervous system, in turn, send out messages which
result in the movement of muscles.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Skeleton.</b>&mdash;In the vertebrates, of which the
bony fish is an example, the skeleton is under the skin, and is hence
called an <i>endoskeleton</i>. It consists of a bony framework, the
vertebral column which protects the spinal cord and certain attached bones,
the ribs, with other spiny bones to which the unpaired fins are attached.
The paired fins are attached to the spinal column by two collections of
bones, known respectively as the <i>pectoral</i> and <i>pelvic girdles</i>.
The bones in the main skeleton serve in the fish for the attachment of
powerful muscles, by means of which locomotion is accomplished. In most
fishes, the <i>exoskeleton</i>, too, is well developed, consisting usually
of scales, but sometimes of bony plates.</p>

<p><b>Food of Fishes.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that in a balanced
aquarium the balance of food was preserved by the plants, which furnished
food for the tiny animals or were eaten by larger ones,&mdash;for example,
snails or fish. The smaller animals in turn became food of larger ones. The
nitrogen balance was maintained through the excretions of the animals and
their death and decay.</p>

<p>The marine world is a great balanced aquarium. The upper layer of water
is crowded with all kinds of little organisms, both plant and animal. Some
of these are microscopic in size; others, as the tiny crustaceans, are
visible to the eye. On these little organisms some fish feed entirely,
others in part. Such are the menhaden<a name= "fnanchor_33" id=
"fnanchor_33"></a><a href= "#footnote_33" class= "fnanchor">[33]</a> (bony,
bunker, mossbunker of our coast), the shad, and others. Other fishes are
bottom feeders, as the blackfish and <a name="Page_238"
id="Page_238"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>the sea bass, living
almost entirely upon mollusks and crustaceans. Still others are hunters,
feeding upon smaller species of fish, or even upon their weaker brothers.
Such are the bluefish, squeteague or weakfish, and others.</p>

<p>What is true of salt-water fish is equally true of those inhabiting our
fresh-water streams and lakes. It is one of the greatest problems of our
Bureau of Fisheries to discover this relation of various fishes to their
food supplies so as to aid in the conservation and balance of life in our
lakes, rivers, and seas.</p>

<p><b>Migration of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Some fishes change their habitat at
different times during the year, moving in vast schools northward in summer
and southward in the winter. In a general way such migrations follow the
coast lines. Examples of such migratory fish are the cod, menhaden,
herring, and bluefish. The migrations are due to temperature changes, to
the seeking after food, and to the spawning instinct. Some fish migrate to
shallower water in the summer and to deeper water in the winter; here the
reason for the migration is doubtless the change in temperature.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Development of a trout. 1, the embryo within the egg;
 2, the young fish just hatched with the yoke sac still attached; 3, the
 young fish.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Egg-laying Habits of the Bony Fishes.</b>&mdash;The eggs of most
bony fishes are laid in great numbers, varying from a few thousand in the
trout to many hundreds of thousands in the shad and several millions in the
cod. The time of egg-laying is usually spring or early summer. At the time
of spawning the male usually deposits milt, consisting of millions of sperm
cells, in the water just over the eggs, thus accomplishing fertilization.
Some <a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
239]</span>fishes, as sticklebacks, sunfish, toadfish, etc., make nests,
but usually the eggs are left to develop by themselves, sometimes attached
to some submerged object, but more frequently free in the water. In some
eggs a tiny oil drop buoys up the egg to the surface, where the heat of the
sun aids development. They are exposed to many dangers, and both eggs and
developing fish are eaten, not only by birds, fish of other species, and
other water inhabitants, but also by their own relatives, and even parents.
Consequently a very small percentage of eggs ever produce mature fish.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of the Spawning Habits to Economic Importance of
Fish.</b>&mdash;The spawning habits of fish are of great importance to us
because of the economic value of fish to mankind, not only directly as a
food, but indirectly as food for other animals in turn valuable to man.
Many of our most desirable food fishes, notably the salmon, shad, sturgeon,
and smelt, pass up rivers from the ocean to deposit their eggs, swimming
against strong currents much of the way, some species leaping rapids and
falls, in order to deposit their eggs in localities where the conditions of
water and food are suitable, and the water shallow enough to allow the
sun's rays to warm it sufficiently to cause the eggs to develop. The
Chinook salmon of the Pacific coast, the salmon used in the Western canning
industry, travels over a thousand miles up the Columbia and other rivers,
where it spawns. The salmon begin to pass up the rivers in early spring,
and reach the spawning beds, shallow deposits of gravel in cool mountain
streams, before late summer. Here the fish, both males and females, remain
until the temperature of the water falls to about 54° Fahrenheit. The eggs
and milt are then deposited, and the old fish die, leaving the eggs to be
hatched out later by the heat of the sun's rays.</p>

<p><b>Need of Conservation.</b>&mdash;The instinct of this and other
species of fish to go into shallow rivers to deposit their eggs has been
made use of by man. At the time of the spawning migration the salmon are
taken in vast numbers, for the salmon fisheries net over $16,000,000
annually.</p>

<p>But the need for conservation of this important national asset is great.
The shad have within recent time abandoned their <a name="Page_240"
id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>breeding places in
the Connecticut River, and the salmon have been exterminated along our
eastern coast within the past few decades. It is only a matter of a few
years when the Western salmon will be extinct if fishing is continued at
the present rate. More fish must be allowed to reach their breeding places.
To do this a closed season on the rivers of two or three days out of each
seven while the shad or the salmon run would do much good.</p>

<p>The sturgeon, the eggs of which are used in the manufacture of the
delicacy known as <i>caviar</i>, is an example of a fish that is almost
extinct in this part of the world. Other food fish taken at the breeding
season are also in danger.</p>

<p><b>Artificial Propagation of Fishes.</b>&mdash;Fortunately, the
government through the Bureau of Fisheries, and various states by wise
protective laws and by artificial propagation of fishes, are beginning to
turn the tide. Certain days of the week the salmon are allowed to pass up
the Columbia unmolested. Closed breeding seasons protect our trout, bass,
and other game fish, also the catching of fish under a certain size is
prohibited.</p>

 <p class="caption">Artificial fertilization of fish eggs.</p>
</div>

<p>Many fish hatcheries, both government and state, are engaged in
artificially fertilizing millions of fish eggs of various species and
protecting the young fry until they are of such size that they can take
care of themselves, when they are placed in ponds or streams. This
artificial fertilization is usually accomplished by first squeezing out the
ripe eggs from a female into a pan of water; in a similar manner the milt
or sperm cells are obtained, and poured over the eggs. The eggs are thus
fertilized. They are then placed in receptacles supplied with running water
and left to develop under favorable conditions. Shortly after the egg has
segmented (divided into many cells) the embryo may be seen developing on
one side <a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
241]</span>of the egg. The rest of the egg is made up of food or yolk, and
when the baby fish hatches it has for some time the yolk attached to its
ventral surface. Eventually the food is absorbed into the body of the fish.
The development of the fish is direct, the young fish becoming an adult
without any great change in form. The young fry are kept under ideal
conditions until later, when they are shipped, sometimes thousands of
miles, to their new homes.</p>

biology be taken up during the fall term the fish only might be used.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">the frog</span></p>

<p><b>Adaptations for Life.</b>&mdash;The most common frog in the eastern
part of the United States is the leopard frog. It is recognized by its
greenish brown body with dark spots, each spot being outlined in a
lighter-colored background. In spite of the apparent lack of harmony with
their surroundings, their color appears to give almost perfect protection.
In some species of frogs the color of the skin changes with the
surroundings of the frog, another means of protection.</p>

<p>Adaptations for life in the water are numerous. The ovoid body, the head
merging into the trunk, the slimy covering (for the frog is provided, like
the fish, with mucus cells in the skin), and the powerful legs with webbed
feet, are all evidences of the life which the frog leads.</p>

<p><b>Locomotion.</b>&mdash;You will notice that the appendages have the
same general position on the body and same number of parts as do your own
(upper arm, forearm, and hand; thigh, shank, and foot, the latter much
longer relatively than your own). Note that while the hand has four
fingers, the foot has five toes, the latter connected by a web. In swimming
the frog uses the stroke we <a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>all aim to make when we are learning to
swim. Most of the energy is liberated from the powerful backward push of
the hind legs, which in a resting position are held doubled up close to the
body. On land, locomotion may be by hopping or crawling.</p>

 width="100" height="222"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">This diagram shows how the frog uses its tongue to
 catch insects.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Sense Organs.</b>&mdash;The frog is well provided with sense organs.
The eyes are large, globular, and placed at the side of the head. When they
are closed, a delicate fold, or third eyelid, called the <i>nictitating
membrane</i>, is drawn over each eye. Frogs probably see best moving
objects at a few feet from them. Their vision is much keener than that of
the fish. The external ear (<i>tympanum</i>) is located just behind the eye
on the side of the body. Frogs hear sounds and distinguish various calls of
their own kind, as is proved by the fact that frogs recognize the warning
notes of their mates when any one is approaching. The inner ear also has to
do with balancing the body as it has in fishes and other vertebrates. Taste
and smell are probably not strong sensations in a frog or toad. They bite
at moving objects of almost any kind when hungry. The long flexible tongue,
which is fastened at the front, is used to catch insects. Experience has
taught these animals that moving things, insects, worms, and the like, make
good food. These they swallow whole, the tiny teeth being used to hold the
food. Touch is a well-developed sense. They also respond to changes in
temperature under water, remaining there in a dormant state for the winter
when the temperature of the air becomes colder than that of the water.</p>

<p><b>Breathing.</b>&mdash;The frog breathes by raising and lowering the
floor of the mouth, pulling in air through the two nostril holes. Then the
little flaps over the holes are closed, and the frog swallows this air,
forcing it down into the baglike lungs. The skin is provided with many tiny
blood vessels, and in winter, while the frogs are dormant at the bottom of
the ponds, it serves as the only organ of respiration.<a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span></p>

 Od, oviduct; O, ovary; Br, brain; Sc, spinal cord; Ba, back bone.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Food Tube and its Glands.</b>&mdash;The mouth leads like a funnel
into a short tube, the <i>gullet</i>. On the lower floor of the mouth can
be seen the slitlike <i>glottis</i> leading to the lungs. The gullet widens
almost at once into a long <i>stomach</i>, which in turn leads into a much
coiled intestine. This widens abruptly at the lower end to form the
<i>large intestine</i>. The latter leads into the <i>cloaca</i> (Latin,
<i>sewer</i>), into which open the <i>kidneys</i>, <i>urinary bladder</i>,
and reproductive organs (<i>ovaries</i> or <i>spermaries</i>). Several
<i>glands</i>, the function of which is to produce digestive fluids, open
into the food tube. These digestive fluids, by means of the ferments or
enzymes contained in them, change insoluble food materials into a soluble
form. This allows of the absorption of food material through the walls of
the food tube into the blood. The glands (having the same names and uses as
those in man) are the <i>salivary glands</i>, which pour their juices into
the mouth, the <i>gastric glands</i> in the walls of the stomach, and the
<i>liver</i> and <i>pancreas</i>, which open into the intestine.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Circulation.</b>&mdash;The frog has a well-developed
heart, composed of a thick-walled muscular ventricle and two thin-walled
auricles. The heart pumps the blood through a system of closed tubes to all
parts of the body. Blood enters the right auricle from all parts of the
body; it then contains considerable carbon dioxide; the blood entering the
left auricle comes from the lungs, hence it contains a considerable amount
of oxygen. Blood leaves the heart through the ventricle, which thus pumps
some blood <a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
244]</span>containing much and some containing little oxygen. Before the
blood from the tissues and lungs has time to mix, however, it leaves the
ventricle and by a delicate adjustment in the vessels leaving the heart
most of the blood containing much oxygen is passed to all the various
organs of the body, while the blood deficient in oxygen, but containing a
large amount of carbon dioxide, is pumped to the lungs, where an exchange
of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place by osmosis.</p>

<p class="smaller">In the tissues of the body wherever work is done the
process of burning or oxidation must take place, for by such means only is
the energy necessary to do the work released. Food in the blood is taken to
the muscle cells or other cells of the body and there oxidized. The
products of the burning&mdash;carbon dioxide&mdash;and any other organic
wastes given off from the tissues must be eliminated from the body. As we
know, the carbon dioxide passes off through the lungs and to some extent
through the skin of the frog, while the nitrogenous wastes, poisons which
must be taken from the blood, are eliminated from it in the kidneys.</p>

<p><b>Change of Form in Development of the Frog.</b>&mdash;Not all
vertebrates develop directly into an adult. The frog, for example, changes
its form completely before it becomes an adult. This change in form is
known as a <i>metamorphosis</i>. Let us examine the development of the
common leopard frog.</p>

</div>

<p>The eggs of this frog are laid in shallow water in the early spring.
Masses of several hundred, which may be found attached to twigs or other
supports under water, are deposited at a single laying. Immediately before
leaving the body of the female they receive a coating of jellylike
material, which swells up after the eggs are laid. Thus they are protected
from the attack of fish or other animals which might use them as food. The
upper side of the egg is dark, the light-colored side being weighted down
with a supply of yolk (food). The fertilized egg soon segments (divides
into many cells), and in a few days, if the weather is warm, these eggs
have each grown into an oblong body which shows the form of a tadpole.
Shortly after the tadpole wriggles out of the jellylike case and begins
life outside the egg. At first it remains attached to some water weed by
means of a pair of suckerlike projections; later a mouth is formed, and the
tadpole begins to feed upon algæ or other tiny water plants. At this time,
about two weeks after the eggs were laid, gills are <a name="Page_245"

outside of the body. Soon after, the external gills are replaced by gills
which grow out under a fold of the skin which forms an operculum somewhat
as in the fish. Water reaches the gills through the mouth and passes out
through a hole on the left side of the body. As the tadpole grows larger,
legs appear, the hind legs first, although for a time locomotion is
performed by means of the tail. In the leopard frog the change from the egg
to adult is completed in one summer. In late July or early August, the
tadpole begins to eat less, the tail becomes smaller (being absorbed into
other parts of the body), and before long the transformation from the
tadpole to the young frog is complete. In the green frog and bullfrog the
metamorphosis is not completed until the beginning of the second summer.
The large tadpoles of such forms bury themselves in the soft mud of the
pond bottom during the winter.</p>

<p>Shortly after the legs appear, the gills begin to be absorbed, and lungs
take their place. At this time the young animal may be seen coming to the
surface of the water for air. Changes in the diet of the animal also occur;
the long, coiled intestine is transformed into a much shorter one. The
animal, now insectivorous in its diet, becomes provided with tiny teeth and
a mobile tongue, instead of keeping the horny jaws used in scraping off
algæ. After the tail has been completely absorbed and the legs have become
full grown, there is no further structural change, and the metamorphosis is
complete.</p>

class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>portion) to the outside of the body. Before
the egg is laid a shell is secreted over its surface. If the fertilized egg
of a hen be broken and carefully examined, on the surface of the yolk will
be found a little circular disk. This is the beginning of the growth of an
<i>embryo</i> chick. If a series of eggs taken from an incubator at periods
of twenty-four hours or less apart were examined, this spot would be found
at first to increase in size; later the little embryo would be found lying
on the surface. Still later small blood vessels could be made out reaching
into the yolk for food, the tiny heart beating as early as the second day
of incubation. After about three weeks of incubation the little chick
hatches; that is, breaks the shell, and emerges in almost the same form as
the adult.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Development of a Mammal.</b>&mdash;In mammals after fertilization the
egg undergoes development within the body of the mother. Instead of blood
vessels connecting the embryo with the yolk as in the chick, here the blood
vessels are attached to an absorbing organ, known as the <i>placenta</i>.
This structure sends branch-like processes into the wall of the
<i>uterus</i> (the organ which holds the embryo) and absorbs nourishment
and oxygen by osmosis from the blood of the mother. After a length of time
which varies in different species of mammals (from about three weeks in a
guinea pig to twenty-two months in an elephant), the young animal is
expelled by muscular contraction of the uterus, or is born. The young,
usually, are born in a helpless condition, then nourished <a
name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>by
milk furnished by the mother until they are able to take other food. Thus
we see as we go higher in the scale of life fewer eggs formed, but those
few eggs are more carefully protected and cared for by the parents. The
chances of their growth into adults are much greater than in the cases when
many eggs are produced.</p>

<p><b>Heredity and what it Means.</b>&mdash;As I look over the
faces of the boys in my class I notice that each boy seems to be more or
less like each other boy in the class; he has a head, body, arms, and legs,
and even in minor ways he resembles each of the other boys in the room.
Moreover, if I should ask him I have no doubt <a name="Page_250"
id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>but that he would
tell me that he resembled in many respects his mother or father. Likewise
if I should ask his <i>parents</i> whom he resembled, they would say, "I
can see his grandmother or his grandfather in him."</p>

<p>This wonderful force which causes the likeness of the child to its
parents and to <i>their</i> parents we call <i>heredity</i>. Heredity
causes the plants as well as animals to be like their parents. If we trace
the workings of heredity in our own individual case, we will probably find
that we are molded like our ancestors not only in physical characteristics
but in mental qualities as well. The ability to play the piano or to paint
is probably as much a case of inheritance as the color of our eyes or the
shape of our nose. We are a complex of physical and mental characters,
received in part from all our ancestors.</p>

 <p class="caption">Variations in the Catalpa caterpillar. (Photographed,
 natural size, by Davison.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Variation.</b>&mdash;But I notice another thing; no boy in the class
before me is <i>exactly</i> like any other boy, even twins having minute
differences. In this wonderful mold of nature each one of us <a
name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
251]</span>tends to be slightly different from his or her parents. Each
plant, each animal, varies to a greater or lesser degree from its immediate
ancestors and may vary to a very great degree. This factor in the lives of
plants and animals is called <i>variation</i>. Heredity and variation are
the cornerstones on which all the work in the improvement of plants and
animals, including man himself, are built.</p>

<p><b>The Bearers of Heredity.</b>&mdash;We have seen that somewhere in
every living cell is a structure known as a nucleus. In this nucleus, which
is a part of the living matter of the cell, are certain very minute
structures always present, known as <i>chromosomes</i>. These chromosomes
(so called because they take up color when stained) are believed to be the
structures which contain the <i>determiners</i> of the qualities which may
be passed from parent plant to offspring or from animal to animal; in other
words, the qualities that are inheritable (see page <a
href="#Page_252">252</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Germ Cells.</b>&mdash;But it has been found that certain cells of
the body, the egg and the sperm cells, before uniting contain only half as
many chromosomes as do the body cells. In preparing for the process of
fertilization, half of these elements have been eliminated, so that when
the egg and sperm cell are united they will have the full number of
chromosomes that the other cells have.</p>

<p>If the chromosomes carry the determiners of the characters which are
inheritable, then it is easy to see that a fertilized egg must contain an
equal number of chromosomes from the bodies of each parent. Consequently
characteristics from each parent are handed down to the new individual.
This seems to be the way in which nature succeeds in obtaining variation,
by providing cell material from two different individuals.</p>

<p><b>Offspring are Part of their Ancestors.</b>&mdash;We can see that if
you or I receive characteristics from our parents and they received
characteristics from their parents, then we too must have some of the
characteristics of the grandparents, and it is a matter of common knowledge
that each of us does have some trait or lineament which can be traced back
to our grandfather or grandmother. Indeed, as far back as we are able to
go, ancestors have added something.<a name="Page_252"

<p><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
253]</span> <b>Charles Darwin and Natural Selection.</b>&mdash;The great
Englishman Charles Darwin was one of the first scientists to realize how
this great force of heredity applied to the development or evolution of
plants and animals. He knew that although animals and plants were like
their ancestors, they also tended to vary. In nature, the variations which
best fitted a plant or animal for life in its own environment were the ones
which were handed down because those having variations which were not
fitted for life in that particular environment would die. Thus nature
seized upon favorable variations and after a time, as the descendants of
each of these individuals also tended to vary, a new species of plant or
animal, fitted for the place it had to live in, would be gradually
evolved.</p>

<p><b>Mutations.</b>&mdash;Recently a new method of variation has been
discovered by a Dutch naturalist, named Hugo de Vries. He found that new
species of plants and animals arise suddenly by "mutations" or steps. This
means that new species instead of arising from very slight variations,
continuing during long periods of years (as Darwin believed), might arise
very suddenly as a very great variation which would at once breed true. It
is easily seen that such a condition would be of immense value to breeders,
as new plants or animals quite unlike their parents might thus be formed
and perpetuated. It will be one of the future problems of plant and animal
breeders to isolate and breed "mutants," as such organisms are called.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Improvement in corn by selection. To the left, the
 corn improved by selection from the original type at the right.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Artificial Selection.</b>&mdash;Darwin reasoned that if nature seized
upon favorable variants, then man, by selecting the variations he wanted,
could form new varieties of plants or animals much more quickly than
nature. And so to-day plant or animal <a name="Page_254"
id="Page_254"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>breeders
<i>select</i> the forms having the characters they wish to perpetuate and
breed them together. This method used by plant and animal breeders is known
as <i>selection</i>.</p>

<p><b>Selective Planting.</b>&mdash;<i>By selective planting we mean
choosing the best plants and planting the seed from these plants with a
view of improving the yield.</i> In doing this we must not necessarily
select the most perfect fruits or grains, but must select seeds from the
<i>best plants</i>. A wheat plant should be selected not from its yield
alone, but from its ability to stand disease and other unfavorable
conditions. In 1862 a Mr. Fultz, of Pennsylvania, found three heads of
beardless or bald wheat while passing through a large field of bearded
wheat. These were probably <i>mutants</i> which had lost the chaff
surrounding the kernel. Mr. Fultz picked them out, sowed them by
themselves, and produced a quantity of wheat now known favorably all over
the world as the Fultz wheat. In selecting wheat, for example, we might
breed for a number of different characters, such as more starch, or more
protein in the grain, a larger yield per acre, ability to stand cold or
drought or to resist plant disease. Each of these characters would have to
be sought for separately and could only be obtained after long and careful
breeding. The work of Mendel (see page <a href="#Page_257">257</a>) when
applied to plant breeding will greatly shorten the time required to produce
better plants of a given kind. By careful seed selection, some Western
farmers have increased their wheat production by 25 per cent. This, if kept
up all over the United States, would mean over $100,000,000 a year in the
pockets of the farmers.</p>

<p><b>Hybridizing.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that pollen from one
flower may be carried to another of the same species, thus producing seeds.
If pollen from one plant be placed on the pistil of another of an
<i>allied</i> species or variety, fertilization <i>may</i> take place and
new plants be eventually produced from the seeds. This process is known as
<i>hybridizing</i>, and the plants produced by this process known as
<i>hybrids</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px">
 <img src="images/i259.jpg"
 width="167" height="254"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">In hybridizing, all of the flower is removed at the
 line (<i>W</i>) except the pistil (<i>P</i>). Then pollen from another
 flower of a nearly related kind is placed on the pistil and the pollinated
 flower covered up with a paper bag. Can you explain why?</p>
</div>

<p>Hybrids are extremely variable, rarely breed from seeds, and often are
apparently quite unlike either parent plant. They must be grown for several
years, and all plants that do not resemble the desired variety must be
killed off, if we expect to produce a hybrid <a name="Page_255"
id="Page_255"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 255]</span>that will breed more
plants like itself. Luther Burbank, the great hybridizer of California,
destroys tens of thousands of plants in order to get one or two with the
characters which he wishes to preserve. Thus he is yearly adding to the
wealth of this country by producing new plants or fruits of commercial
value. A number of years ago he succeeded in growing a new variety of
potato, which has already enriched the farmers of this country about
$20,000,000. One of his varieties of black walnut trees, a very valuable
hard wood, grows ten to twelve times as rapidly as ordinary black walnuts.
With lumber yearly increasing in price, a quick growing tree becomes a very
valuable commercial product. Among his famous hybrids are the plumcot, a
cross between an apricot and a plum, his numerous varieties of berries and
his splendid "Climax" plum, the result of a cross between a bitter Chinese
plum and an edible Japanese plum. But none of Burbank's products grow from
seeds; they are all produced <i>asexually</i>, from hybrids by some of the
processes described in the next paragraph.</p>

<p><b>The Department of Agriculture and its Methods.</b>&mdash;The
Department of Agriculture is also doing splendid work in producing new
varieties of oranges and lemons, of grain and various garden vegetables.
The greatest possibilities have been shown by department workers to be open
to the farmer or fruit grower through hybridizing, and by budding,
grafting, or slipping.</p>

<p><i>Budding.</i>&mdash;If a given tree, for example, produces a kind of
fruit which is of excellent quality, it is possible sometimes to attach
parts of the tree to another strong tree of the same species that may not
bear good fruit. This is done by <i>budding</i>. A T-shaped incision is cut
in the bark; a bud from the tree bearing the desired fruit is placed in the
cut and bound in place. When a shoot from the <a name="Page_256"
id="Page_256"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>embedded bud grows
out the following spring, it is found to have all the characters of the
tree from which it was taken.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Grafting.</b>&mdash;Of much the same nature is grafting. Here,
however, a small portion of the stem of the closely allied tree is fastened
into the trunk of the growing tree in such a manner that the two cut layers
just under the bark will coincide. This will allow of the passage of food
into the grafted part and insure the ultimate growth of the twig. Grafting
and budding are of considerable economic value to the fruit grower, as it
enables him to produce at will, trees bearing choice varieties of fruit.<a

"fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><b>Other Methods.</b>&mdash;Other methods of plant propagation are by
means of runners, as when strawberry plants strike root from long stems
that run along the ground; layering, where roots may develop on covered up
branches of blackberry or raspberry plants; slips, roots developing from
stems which are cut off and placed in moist sand; from tubers, as in
planting potatoes; and by means of <a name="Page_257"
id="Page_257"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>bulbs, as the tulip
or hyacinth. All of the above means of propagation are asexual and are of
importance in our problem of plant breeding.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Work of Gregor Mendel.</b>&mdash;Fifty years ago, an Austrian
monk, Gregor Mendel, found in breeding garden peas that these plants passed
on certain <i>fixed characters</i>, as the shape of the seed, the color of
the pod when ripe, and others, and that when two pea plants of different
characters were crossed, one of these <a name="Page_258"
id="Page_258"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>characters would be
likely to appear in the offspring of the second generation in the ratio of
three to one. Such characters as would appear to the exclusion of others in
the first crossing of the plants were called <i>dominant</i>, the ones not
appearing, <i>recessive</i> characteristics. When these seeds were again
sown the ones bearing a recessive characteristic would produce only peas
with this recessive characteristic, but the ones with a dominant
characteristic might give rise to a pure dominant or to offspring having
partly a dominant and partly a recessive character; pure dominants being to
the mixed offspring in the ratio of 1 to 2. The pure dominants if bred with
others like themselves would produce only pure dominants, but the cross
breeds would again produce mixed offspring of three kinds in the ratio of
one dominant to two cross breeds and one recessive. The feature of this
work that interests us is that <i>unit</i> characters are passed along by
heredity in the germ cells <i>pure</i>, that is, unchanged, from one
generation to another, and independently of each other.</p>

<p><b>Determiners of Character.</b>&mdash;A child then resembles his
parents in some definite particulars because certain <i>determiners</i> of
characters have been present in the germ cells of one of the parents. If
the determiner of a certain character is <i>absent</i> from the germ cells
of both parents, it will be <i>absent</i> in <i>all</i> of their
offspring.</p>

 <p class="captionj">What has resulted from artificial selection among
 dogs. (After Romanes.)</p>
</div>

<p>These discoveries of Mendel are of the greatest importance in plant and
animal breeding because they enable the breeder to <a name="Page_259"
id="Page_259"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>isolate certain
characters and by proper selection to breed varieties which have these
desired characters, instead of waiting for a <i>chance</i> union of the
desired characters by nature.</p>

<p><b>Animal Breeding.</b>&mdash;It has been pointed out that the
domestication of wild animals, the horse, cattle, sheep, goats, and the
dog, marked a great advance in civilization in the history of the earth's
peoples. As the young of these animals came to be bred in captivity the
peoples owning them would undoubtedly pick out the strongest and best of
the offspring, killing off the others for food. Thus they came
unconsciously to select and aid nature in producing a stronger and better
stock. Later man began to recognize certain characters that he wished to
have in horses, dogs, or cattle, and so by slow processes of breeding and
"crossing" or hybridizing one nearly allied form with another the numerous
groups of domesticated animals began to appear.</p>

<p>In Darwin's time animal breeding was so far advanced that he got his
ideas of selection by nature in evolution from the artificial selection
practiced by animal breeders. A glance at the pictures will give some idea
of the changes that have taken place in the form of some animals since man
began to breed them a few thousand years ago.<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">

</div>

<p><b>Some Domesticated Animals.</b>&mdash;Our domesticated dogs are
descended from a number of wolflike forms in various parts of the world.
All the present races of cats, on the other hand, seem to be traced back to
Egypt. Modern horses are first noted in Europe and Asia, but far older
forms flourished on the earth in former geologic periods. It is interesting
to note that America was the original home of the horse, although at the
time of the earliest explorers the horse was unknown here, the wild horse
of the Western plains having arisen from horses introduced by the
Spaniards. Long ages ago, the first ancestors of the horse were probably
little animals about the size of a fox. The earliest horse we have
knowledge of had four toes on the fore and three toes on the hind foot.
Thousands of years later we find a larger horse, the size of a sheep, with
a three-toed foot. By gradual changes, caused by the tendency of the
animals to vary and by the action of the surroundings upon the animal in
preserving these variations, there was eventually produced our present
horse, an animal with legs adapted for rapid locomotion, with feet
particularly fitted for the life in open fields, and with teeth which serve
well to seize and grind herbage. Knowledge of this sort was also used by
Darwin to show that constant changes in the form of animals have been
taking place since life began on the earth.</p>

<p>The horse, which for some reason disappeared in this country, continued
to exist in Europe, and man, emerging from his early savage condition,
began to make use of the animal. We know the horse was domesticated in
early Biblical times, and that he soon became one of man's most valued
servants. In more recent times, man has begun to change the horse by
breeding for certain desired characteristics. In this manner have been

class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>improved the various types of horses
familiar to us as draft horses, coach horses, hackneys, and the
trotters.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that all the various domesticated animals have
been tremendously changed in a similar manner since civilized man has come
to live on the earth. When we realize the very great amount of money
invested in domesticated animals; that there are over 60,000,000 each of
sheep, cattle, and swine and over 20,000,000 horses owned in this country,
then we may see how very important a part the domestic animals play in our
lives.</p>

<p><b>Improvement of Man.</b>&mdash;If the stock of domesticated animals
can be improved, it is not unfair to ask if the health and vigor of the
future generations of men and women on the earth might not be improved by
applying to them the laws of selection. This improvement of the future race
has a number of factors in which we as individuals may play a part. These
are personal hygiene, selection of healthy mates, and the betterment of the
environment.</p>

<p><b>Personal Hygiene.</b>&mdash;In the first place, good health is the
one greatest asset in life. We may be born with a poor bodily machine, but
if we learn to recognize its defects and care for it properly, we may make
it do its required work effectively. If certain muscles are poorly
developed, then by proper exercise we may make them stronger. If our eyes
have some defect, we can have it remedied by wearing glasses. If certain
drugs or alcohol lower the efficiency of the machine, we can avoid their
use. With proper <i>care</i> a poorly developed body may be improved and do
effective work.</p>

<p><b>Eugenics.</b>&mdash;When people marry there are certain things that
the individual as well as the race should demand. The most important of
these is freedom from germ diseases which might be handed down to the
offspring. Tuberculosis, syphilis, that dread disease which cripples and
kills hundreds of thousands of innocent children, epilepsy, and
feeble-mindedness are handicaps which it is not only unfair but criminal to
hand down to posterity. The science of being well born is called
<i>eugenics</i>.</p>

 family for three generations. A normal woman married an alcoholic and

 children were born feeble-minded. One of these children married another
 feeble-minded woman, and of their five children two died in infancy and
 three were feeble-minded. (After Davenport.)</p>

 <p class="captionj">This chart shows that feeble-mindedness is a
 characteristic sure to be handed down in a family where it exists. The
 feeble-minded woman at the top left of the chart married twice. The first
 children from a normal father are all normal, but the other children from
 an alcoholic father are all feeble-minded. The right-hand side of the
 chart shows a terrible record of feeble-mindedness. Should feeble-minded
 people be allowed to marry? (After Davenport.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Jukes.</b>&mdash;Studies have been made on a number of different
families in this country, in which mental and moral defects were present in
one or both of the original parents. The "Jukes" family is a notorious
example. The first mother is known as <a name="Page_262"
id="Page_262"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>"Margaret, the
mother of criminals." In seventy-five years the progeny of the original
generation has cost the state of New York over a million and a quarter of
dollars, besides giving over to the care of prisons and asylums
considerably over a hundred feeble-minded, alcoholic, immoral, or criminal
persons. Another case recently studied is the "Kallikak" family.<a name=
"fnanchor_35" id= "fnanchor_35"></a><a href= "#footnote_35" class=
"fnanchor">[35]</a> This family has been traced back to the War of the
Revolution, when a young soldier named Martin Kallikak seduced a
feeble-minded girl. <a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>She had a feeble-minded son from whom there
have been to the present time 480 descendants. Of these 33 were sexually
immoral, 24 confirmed drunkards, 3 epileptics, and 143
<i>feeble-minded</i>. The man who started this terrible line of immorality
and feeble-mindedness later married a normal Quaker girl. From this couple
a line of 496 descendants have come, with <i>no</i> cases of
feeble-mindedness. The evidence and the moral speak for themselves!</p>

<p><b>Parasitism and its Cost to Society.</b>&mdash;Hundreds of families
such as those described above exist to-day, spreading disease, immorality,
and crime to all parts of this country. The cost to society of such
families is very severe. Just as certain animals or plants become parasitic
on other plants or animals, these families have become parasitic on
society. They not only do harm to others by corrupting, stealing, or
spreading disease, but they are actually protected and cared for by the
state out of public money. Largely for them the poorhouse and the asylum
exist. They take from society, but they give nothing in return. They are
true parasites.</p>

<p><b>The Remedy.</b>&mdash;If such people were lower animals, we would
probably kill them off to prevent them from spreading. Humanity will not
allow this, but we do have the remedy of separating the sexes in asylums or
other places and in various ways preventing intermarriage and the
possibilities of perpetuating such a low and degenerate race. Remedies of
this sort have been tried successfully in Europe and are now meeting with
success in this country.</p>

<p><b>Blood Tells.</b>&mdash;Eugenics show us, on the other hand, in a
study of the families in which are brilliant men and women, the fact that
the descendants have received the <i>good</i> inheritance from their
ancestors. The following, taken from Davenport's <i>Heredity in Relation to
Eugenics</i>, illustrates how one family has been famous in American
History.</p>

<p>In 1667 Elizabeth Tuttle, "of strong will, and of extreme intellectual
vigor, married Richard Edwards of Hartford, Conn., a man of high repute and
great erudition. From their one son descended another son, Jonathan
Edwards, a noted divine, and president of Princeton College. Of the
descendants of Jonathan Edwards much has been written; a brief catalogue
must suffice: Jonathan Edwards, Jr., president of Union College; Timothy <a
name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
264]</span>Dwight, president of Yale; Sereno Edwards Dwight, president of
Hamilton College; Theodore Dwight Woolsey, for twenty-five years president
of Yale College; Sarah, wife of Tapping Reeve, founder of Litchfield Law
School, herself no mean lawyer; Daniel Tyler, a general in the Civil War
and founder of the iron industries of North Alabama; Timothy Dwight,
second, president of Yale University from 1886 to 1898; Theodore William
Dwight, founder and for thirty-three years warden of Columbia Law School;
Henrietta Frances, wife of Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, who,
burning the midnight oil by the side of her ingenious husband, helped him
to his enduring fame; Merrill Edwards Gates, president of Amherst College;
Catherine Maria Sedgwick of graceful pen; Charles Sedgwick Minot, authority
on biology and embryology in the Harvard Medical School; Edith Kermit
Carow, wife of Theodore Roosevelt; and Winston Churchill, the author of
<i>Coniston</i> and other well-known novels."</p>

 width="500" height="141"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">This record shows the inheritance of artistic ability
 (black circles and squares). (After Davenport.)</p>
</div>

<p>Of the daughters of Elizabeth Tuttle distinguished descendants also
came. Robert Treat Paine, signer of the Declaration of Independence; Chief
Justice of the United States Morrison R. Waite; Ulysses S. Grant and Grover
Cleveland, presidents of the United States. These and many other prominent
men and women can trace the characters which enabled them to occupy the
positions of culture and learning they held back to Elizabeth Tuttle.</p>

<p><b>Euthenics.</b>&mdash;Euthenics, the betterment of the environment, is
another important factor in the production of a stronger race. The
strongest physical characteristics may be ruined if the surroundings are
unwholesome and unsanitary. The slums of a city <a name="Page_265"
id="Page_265"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>are "at once
symptom, effect, and cause of evil." A city which allows foul tenements,
narrow streets, and crowded slums to exist will spend too much for police
protection, for charity, and for hospitals.</p>

<p>Every improvement in surroundings means improvement of the chances of
survival of the race. In the spring of 1913 the health department and
street-cleaning department of the city of New York coöperated to bring
about a "clean up" of all filth, dirt, and rubbish from the houses,
streets, and vacant lots in that city. During the summer of 1913 the health
department reported a smaller percentage of deaths of babies than ever
before. We must draw our own conclusions. Clean streets and houses, clean
milk and pure water, sanitary housing, and careful medical inspection all
do their part in maintaining a low rate of illness and death, thus reacting
upon the health of the citizens of the future. It will be the purpose of
the following pages to show how we may best care for our own bodies and how
we may better the environment in which we are placed.</p>

<h3>XVIII. THE HUMAN MACHINE AND ITS NEEDS</h3>

<p><i><b>Problem.</b>&mdash;To obtain a general understanding of the parts
and uses of the bodily machine.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Laboratory Suggestions</span></p>

<p class="indentref"><i>Demonstration.</i>&mdash;Review to show that the
human body is a complex of cells.</p>

<p class="demo"><i>Laboratory demonstration</i> by means of (<i>a</i>)
human skeleton and (<i>b</i>) manikin to show the position and gross
structure of the chief organs of man.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Man and his Environment.</b>&mdash;In the last chapter we
saw that one factor in the improvement of man lies in giving him better
surroundings. It will be the purpose of the following chapters to show how
man is fitted to live in the environment in which he is placed. He comes in
contact with air, light, water, soil, food, and shelter which make his
somewhat artificial environment; he must adapt himself to get the best he
can out of this environment.</p>

<p><b>The Needs of Living Things.</b>&mdash;We have already found that the
primary needs of plants and animals are the same. They both need food, they
both need to digest their food and to have it circulate in a fluid form to
the cells where it will be used. They both need oxygen so as to release the
energy locked up in their food. And they both need to reproduce so that
their kind may be continued on the earth. What is true of plants and other
animals is true of man.</p>

<p><b>The Needs of Simple and Complex Animals the Same.</b>&mdash;The
simplest animal, a single cell, has the same needs as the most complex. The
<i>cell</i> param&oelig;cium feeds, digests, oxidizes its food, and
releases energy. The <i>cells</i> of the human body built up into tissues
have the same needs and perform the same functions as the param&oelig;cium.
It is the <i>cells</i> of the body working together <a name="Page_267"
id="Page_267"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>in groups as tissues
and organs that make the complicated actions of man possible. Division of
labor has arisen because of the complex needs and work of the organism.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px">
 <img src="images/i271.jpg"
 width="200" height="469"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">The human body seen from the side in longitudinal
 section.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Human Body a Machine.</b>&mdash;In all animals, and the human
animal is no exception, the body has been likened to a machine in that it
turns over the <i>latent</i> or potential energy stored up in food into
<i>kinetic</i> energy (mechanical work and heat), which is manifested when
we perform work. One great difference exists between an engine and the
human body. The engine uses fuel unlike the substance out of which it is
made. The human body, on the other hand, uses for fuel the same substances
out of which it is formed; it may, indeed, use part of its own substance
for food. It must as well do more than purely mechanical work. The human
organism must be so delicately adjusted to its surroundings that it will
react in a ready manner to stimuli from without; it must be able to utilize
its fuel (food) in the most economical manner; it must be fitted with
machinery for transforming the energy received from food into various kinds
of work; it must properly provide the machine with oxygen so that the fuel
will be oxidized, and the products of oxidation must be carried away, as
well as other waste materials which might harm the effectiveness of the
machine. Most important of all, the human machine must be able to repair
itself.</p>

<p>In order to understand better this complicated machine, the human body,
let us briefly examine the structure of its parts and thus get a better
idea of the interrelation of these parts and of their functions.<a

<p><b>The Skin.</b>&mdash;Covering the body is a protective structure
called the skin. Covered on the outside with dead cells, yet it is provided
with delicate sense organs, which give us perception of touch, taste,
smell, pressure, and temperature. It also aids in getting wastes out of the
body by means of its sweat glands and plays an important part in equalizing
the temperature of the body.</p>

<p><b>Bones and Muscles.</b>&mdash;The body is built around a framework of
bones. These bones, which are bound together by tough <i>ligaments</i>,
fall naturally into two great groups, the bones of the body proper,
vertebral column, ribs, breast bone, and skull, which form the <i>axial</i>
skeleton, and the appendages, two sets of bones which form the framework of
the arms and legs, which with the bones which attach them to the axial
skeleton form the <i>appendicular</i> skeleton.</p>

<p>To the bones are attached the muscles of the body. Movement is
accomplished by contraction of muscles, which are attached so as to cause
the bones to act as levers. Bones also protect the nervous system and other
delicate organs. They also help to give form and rigidity to the body.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Hygiene&nbsp;of&nbsp;Muscles&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bones.</b>&mdash;Young
people especially need to know how to prevent certain defects which are
largely the result of bad habits of posture. Standing erect <a
name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>is
an example of a good habit, round shoulders a bad habit of this sort. The
habit of a wrong position of bones and muscles once formed is very hard to
correct. This can best be done by certain corrective exercises at home or
in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Round shoulders is most common among people whose occupation causes them
to stoop. Drawing, writing, and a wrong position when at one's desk are
among the causes. Exercises which strengthen the back muscles and cause the
head to be kept erect are helpful in forming the habit of erect
carriage.</p>

<p>Slight curvature of the spine either backward or forward is helped most
by exercises which tend to straighten the body, such as stretching up with
the hands above the head. Lateral curvature of the spine, too often caused
by a "hunched-up" position at the school desk, may also be corrected by
exercises which tend to lengthen the spinal column.</p>

<p>It is the duty of every girl and boy to have good posture and <a
name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
270]</span>erect carriage, not only because of the better state of health
which comes with it, but also because one's self-respect demands that each
one of us makes the best of the gifts that nature has given us. An erect
head, straight shoulders, and elastic carriage go far toward making their
owner both liked and respected.</p>

<p><b>Other Body Structures.</b>&mdash;In spaces between the muscles are
found various other structures,&mdash;blood vessels, which carry blood to
and from the great pumping station, the heart, and thence to all parts of
the body; connective tissue, which holds groups of muscle or other cells
together; fat cells, scattered in various parts of the body; various gland
cells, which manufacture enzymes; and the cells of the nervous system,
which aid in directing the body parts.</p>

<p><b>Body Cavity.</b>&mdash;Within the body is a cavity, which in life is
almost completely filled with various organs. A thin wall of muscle called
the <i>diaphragm</i> divides the body cavity into two unequal spaces. In
the upper space are found the <i>heart</i> and <i>lungs</i>, in the lower,
the digestive tract with its glands, the <i>liver</i>, <i>kidneys</i>, and
other structures (see page <a href="#Page_267">267</a>).</p>

<p><b>Digestion, Absorption, and Excretion.</b>&mdash;Running through the
body is a food tube in which undigested food is placed and from which
digested or liquid food is absorbed into the blood so that the cells of the
various organs which do the work may receive food. Emptying into this food
tube are various groups of gland cells, which pour digestive fluids over
the solid foods, thus aiding in changing them to liquids. Solid wastes are
passed out through the posterior end of the food tube, while liquid wastes
are excreted by means of glands called <i>kidneys</i>.</p>

<p><b>Work done by Cells.</b>&mdash;Food, prepared in the digestive tract,
and oxygen from the lungs are taken by the blood to the cells. Bathed in
liquid food, the cells do their work; they promote the oxidization of food
and the exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen in the blood, while other
wastes of the cells are given off, to pass eventually through the kidneys
and out of the body.</p>

<p><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
271]</span><b>The Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The smooth working of the
bodily machine is due to another set of structures which direct the working
of the parts so that they will act in unison. This director is the nervous
system. We have seen that, in the simplest of animals, one cell performs
the functions necessary to its existence. In the more complex animals,
where groups of cells form tissues, each having a different function, a
nervous system is developed. <i>The functions of the human nervous system
are:</i> (1) <i>the providing of man with sensation, by means of which he
gets in touch with the world about him;</i> (2) <i>the connecting of organs
in different parts of the body so that they act as a united and harmonious
whole;</i> (3) <i>the giving to the human being a will, a provision for
thought.</i> Coöperation in word and deed is the end attained. We are all
familiar with examples of the coöperation of organs. You see food; the
thought comes that it is good to eat; you reach out, take it, raise it to
the mouth; the jaws move in response to your will; the food is chewed and
swallowed. While digestion and absorption of the food are taking place, the
nervous system is still in control. The nervous system also regulates
pumping of blood over the body, respiration, secretion of glands, and,
indeed, every bodily function. Man is the highest of all animals because of
the extreme development of the nervous system. Man is the thinking animal,
and as such is master of the earth.</p>

or food. They oxidize it and release the energy in it. But the living
organism in addition may use the food to repair parts that have broken down
or even build new parts. <i>Thus food may be defined as something that

matter or material which can be oxidized to release energy when muscle
cells move, or gland cells secrete, or brain cells think.</p>

 food?
</p>
</div>

<p><b>Nutrients.</b>&mdash;Certain nutrient materials form the basis of
food of both plants and animals. These have been stated to be
<i>proteins</i> (such as lean meat, eggs, the gluten of bread),
<i>carbohydrates</i> (starches, sugars, gums, etc.), <i>fats</i> and
<i>oils</i> (both animal and vegetable), <i>mineral matter</i> and
<i>water</i>.</p>

<p><b>Proteins.</b>&mdash;Protein substances contain the element nitrogen.
Hence such foods are called nitrogenous foods. Man must form the protoplasm
of his body (that is, the muscles, tendons, nervous system, blood
corpuscles, the living parts of the bone and the skin, etc.) in part at
least from nitrogenous food. Some of this he obtains by eating the flesh of
animals, and some he obtains directly from plants (for example, peas and
beans). Proteins are the only foods available for tissue building. They may
be oxidized to release energy if occasion requires it.</p>

<p><b>Fats and Oils.</b>&mdash;Fats and oils, both animal and vegetable,
are the materials from which the body derives part of its energy. The
chemical formula of a fat shows that, compared with other food substances,
there is very little oxygen present; hence the greater capacity of this
substance for uniting with oxygen. The rapid burning of fat compared with
the slower combustion of a piece of meat or a piece of bread illustrates
this. A pound of butter releases over twice as much energy to the body as
does a pound of sugar or a pound of steak. Human fatty tissue is formed in
part from fat eaten, but carbohydrate or even protein food may be changed
and stored in the body as fat.</p>

<p><b>Carbohydrates.</b>&mdash;We see that the carbohydrates, like the
fats, contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. <i>Carbohydrates are
essentially energy-producing foods.</i> They are, however, of use in
building <a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
274]</span>up or repairing tissue. It is certainly true that in both plants
and animals such foods pass directly, together with foods containing
nitrogen, to repair waste in tissues, thus giving the needed proportion of
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen to unite with the nitrogen in forming the
protoplasm of the body.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Three portions of foods, each of which furnishes about
 the same amount of nourishment.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Inorganic Foods.</b>&mdash;Water forms a large part of almost every
food substance. It forms about five sixths of a normal daily diet. The
human body, by weight, is about two thirds water. About 90 per cent of the
blood is water. Water is absolutely essential in passing off waste of the
body. When we drink water, we take with it some of the inorganic salts used
by the body in the making of bone and in the formation of protoplasm.
Sodium chloride (table salt), an important part of the blood, is taken in
as a flavoring upon our meats and vegetables. Phosphate of lime and potash
are important factors in the formation of bone.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is a necessary substance for the making of living matter,
milk, eggs, meat, whole wheat, and dried peas and beans containing small
amounts of it. Iron also is an extremely important mineral, for it is used
in the building of red blood cells. Meats, eggs, peas and beans, spinach,
and prunes, are foods containing some iron.</p>

<p>Some other salts, compounds of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and
phosphorus, have been recently found to aid the body in many of its most
important functions. The beating of the heart, the contraction of muscles,
and the ability of the nerves to do their work appear to be due to the
presence of minute quantities of these salts in the body.</p>

<p><b>Common Foods contain the Nutrients.</b>&mdash;We have already found
in our plant study that various plant foods are rich in different
nutrients, carbohydrates forming the chief nutrient in the foods we call
cereals, breads, cake, fleshy fruits, sugars, jellies, and the like. Fats
and oils are most largely found in nuts and some grains. Animal foods are
our chief supply of protein. White of egg and lean meat are almost pure
protein and water. Proteins are most abundant, as we should expect, in
those plants which are richly supplied with nitrogen; peas and beans, and
in grains and nuts. Fats, which are melted into oils at the temperature of
the body, are represented by the fat in meats, bacon, pork, lard, butter,
and vegetable oils.</p>

<p><b>Water.</b>&mdash;Water is, as we have seen, a valuable part of food.
It makes up a very high percentage of fresh fruits and vegetables; it is
also present in milk and eggs, less abundant in meats and fish, and is
lowest in dried foods and nuts. The amount of water in a given food is
often a decided factor in the cost of the given food, as can easily be seen
by reference to the chart on page <a href="#Page_283">283</a>.<a
name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span></p>

 fat; of carbohydrate. Find some food in which the proportions of protein,
 fat, and carbohydrate are combined in a good proportion.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Refuse.</b>&mdash;Some foods bought in the market may contain a
certain unusable portion. This we call refuse. Examples of <a
name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
277]</span>refuse are bones in meat, shells of eggs or of shellfish, the
covering of plant cells which form the skins of potatoes or other
vegetables. The amount of refuse present also plays an important part in
the values of foods for the table. The table<a name= "fnanchor_37" id=
"fnanchor_37"></a><a href= "#footnote_37" class= "fnanchor">[37]</a> on
page <a href="#Page_276">276</a> gives the percentages of organic
nutrients, water, and refuse present in some common foods.</p>

<p><b>Fuel Values of Nutrients.</b>&mdash;In experiments performed by
Professor Atwater and others, and in the appended tables, the value of food
as a source of energy is stated in heat units called <i>Calories</i>. <i>A
Calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one
kilogram of water from zero to one degree Centigrade.</i> This is about
equivalent to raising one pound four degrees Fahrenheit. The fuel value of
different foods may be computed in a definite manner. This is done by
burning a given portion of a food (say one gram) in the apparatus known as
a <i>calorimeter</i>. By this means may be determined the number of degrees
the temperature of a given amount of water is raised during the process of
burning. It has thus been found that a gram of fat will liberate 9.3
Calories of heat, while a gram of starch or sugar only about 4 Calories.
The burning value of fat is, therefore, over twice that of carbohydrates.
In a similar manner protein has been shown to have about the same fuel
value as carbohydrates, <i>i.e.</i> 4 Calories to a gram.<a name=
"fnanchor_38" id= "fnanchor_38"></a><a href= "#footnote_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><b>The Relation of Work to Diet.</b>&mdash;It has been shown
experimentally that a man doing hard, muscular work needs more food than a
person doing light work. The mere exercise gives the individual a hearty
appetite; he eats more and needs more of all kinds of food than a man or
boy doing light work. Especially is it true that the person of sedentary
habits, who does brain work, should be careful to eat less food and food
that will digest easily. His protein food should also be reduced. Rich or
hearty foods may be left for the man who is doing hard manual labor out of
doors, for any extra work put on the digestive organs takes away just so
much from the ability of the brain to do its work.<a name="Page_278"

</div>

<p><b>The Relation of Environment to Diet.</b>&mdash;We are all aware of
the fact that the body seems to crave more food in winter than in summer.
The temperature of the body is maintained at 98.6° in winter as in summer,
but much more heat is lost from the body in cold weather. Hence feeding in
winter should be for the purpose of maintaining our fuel supply. We need
heat-producing food, and we need <i>more</i> food in winter than in summer.
We may use carbohydrates for this purpose, as they are economical and
digestible. The inhabitants of cold countries get their heat-releasing
foods largely from fats. In tropical countries and in hot weather little
protein should be eaten and a considerable amount of fresh fruit used.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Age to Diet.</b>&mdash;As we will see a little later,
age is a factor not only in determining the kind but the amount of food to
be used. Young children require far less food than do those of older growth
or adults. The body constantly increases in weight until young manhood, or
womanhood, then its weight remains nearly stationary, varying with health
or illness. It is evident that food in adults simply repairs the waste of
cells and is used to supply energy. Elderly people need much less protein
than do younger persons. But inasmuch as the amount of food to be taken
into the body should be in proportion to the body weight, it is also
evident that growing children do not, as is popularly supposed, need as
much food as grown-ups.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Sex to Diet.</b>&mdash;As a rule boys need more food
than girls, and men than women. This seems to be due to, first, the more
active muscular life of the man and, secondly, to the <a name="Page_281"
id="Page_281"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>greater amount of
fat in the tissues of the woman, making loss of heat less. Larger bodies,
because of greater surface, give off more heat than smaller ones. Men are
usually larger in bulk than are women,&mdash;another reason for more food
in their case.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Digestibility to Diet.</b>&mdash;Animal foods in
general may be said to be more completely digested within the body than
plant foods. This is largely due to the fact that plant cells have woody
walls that the digestive juices cannot act upon. Cereals and legumes are
less digestible foods than are dairy products, meat, or fish. This does not
mean necessarily that these foods would not agree with you or me but that
in general the body would get less nourishment out of the total amount
available.</p>

<p>The agreement or disagreement of food with an individual is largely a
personal matter. I, for example, cannot eat raw tomatoes without suffering
from indigestion, while some one else can digest tomatoes but not
strawberries. Each individual should learn early in life the foods that
disagree with him personally and leave such foods out of his dietary. For
"what is one man's meat may be another man's poison."</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Cost of Food to Diet.</b>&mdash;It is a mistaken
notion that the best foods are always the most expensive. A glance at the
table (page <a href="#Page_283">283</a>) will show us that both fuel value
and tissue-building value is present in some foods from vegetable sources,
as well as in those from animal sources, and that the vegetable foods are
much cheaper. The American people are far less economical in their purchase
of food than most other nations. Nearly one half of the total income of the
average workingman is spent on food. Not only does he spend a large amount
on food, but he wastes money in purchasing the wrong kinds of food. A
comparison of the daily diets of persons in various occupations in this and
other countries shows that as a rule we eat more than is necessary to
supply the necessary fuel and repair, and that our workingmen eat more than
those of other countries. Another waste of money by the American is in the
false notion that a large proportion of the daily dietary should be meat.
Many people think that the most expensive cuts of meat are the most
nutritious. <a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
282]</span>The falsity of this idea may be seen by a careful study of the
tables on pages <a href="#Page_283">283</a> and <a
href="#Page_286">286</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Best Dietary.</b>&mdash;Inasmuch as all living substance contains
nitrogen, it is evident that protein food must form a part of the dietary;
but protein alone is not usable. If more protein is eaten than the body
requires, then immediately the liver and kidneys have to work overtime to
get rid of the excess of protein which forms a poisonous waste harmful to
the body. We must take foods that will give us, as nearly as possible, the
proportion of the different chemical elements as they are contained in
protoplasm. It has been found, as a result of studies of Atwater and
others, that a man who does muscular work requires a little less than one
quarter of a pound of protein, the same amount of fat, and about one pound
of carbohydrate to provide for the growth, waste, and repair of the body
and the energy used up in one day.</p>

<p><b>The Daily Calorie Requirement.</b>&mdash;Put in another way,
Atwater's standard for a man at light exercise is food enough to yield 2816
Calories; of these, 410 Calories are from protein, 930 Calories from fat,
and 1476 Calories from carbohydrate. That is, for every 100 Calories
furnished by the food, 14 are from protein, 32 from fat, and 54 from
carbohydrate. In exact numbers, the day's ration as advocated by Atwater
would contain about 100 grams or 3.7 ounces protein, 100 grams or 3.7
ounces fat, and 360 grams or 13 ounces carbohydrate. Professor Chittenden
of Yale University, another food expert, thinks we need proteins, fats, and
carbohydrates in about the proportion of 1 to 3 to 6, thus differing from
Atwater in giving less protein in proportion. Chittenden's standard for the
same man is food to yield a total of 2360 Calories, of which protein
furnishes 236 Calories, fat 708 Calories, and carbohydrates 1416 Calories.
For every 100 Calories furnished by the food, 10 are from protein, 30 from
fat, 60 from carbohydrate. In actual amount the Chittenden diet would
contain 2.16 ounces protein, 2.83 ounces fat, and 13 ounces carbohydrate. A
German named Voit gives as ideal 25 Calories from proteins, 20 from fat,
and 55 from carbohydrate, out of every 100 Calories; this is nearer our
actual daily ration. In addition, an ounce of salt and nearly one hundred
ounces of water are used in a day.<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a><span

</div>

<p><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
284]</span> <b>A Mixed Diet Best.</b>&mdash;Knowing the proportion of the
different food substances required by man, it will be an easy matter to
determine from the tables and charts shown you the best foods for use in a
mixed diet. Meats contain too much nitrogen in proportion to the other
substances. In milk, the proportion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats is
nearly right to make protoplasm; a considerable amount of mineral matter
being also present. For these reasons, milk is extensively used as a food
for children, as it combines food material for the forming of protoplasm
with mineral matter for the building of bone. Some vegetables (for example,
peas and beans) contain a large amount of nitrogenous material but in a
less digestible form than is found in some other foods. Vegetarians, then,
are correct in theory when they state that a diet of vegetables may contain
everything necessary to sustain life. But a mixed diet containing meat is
healthier. A purely vegetable diet contains much waste material, such as
the cellulose forming the walls of plant cells, which is indigestible. It
has been recently discovered that the outer coats of some grains, as rice,
contain certain substances (enzymes) which aid in digestion. In the case of
polished rice, when this outer coat is removed the grain has much less food
value.</p>

<p><b>Daily Fuel Needs of the Body.</b>&mdash;It has been pointed out that
the daily diet should differ widely according to age, occupation, time of
year, etc. The following table shows the daily fuel needs for several ages
and occupations:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>How we may Find whether we are Eating a properly Balanced
Diet.</b>&mdash;We already know approximately our daily Calorie needs and
about the proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrate needed. Dr. Irving
Fisher of Yale University has worked out a very easy method of determining
whether one is living on a proper diet. He has made up a number of tables,
in which he has designated portions of food, each of which furnishes 100
Calories of energy. <a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>The tables show the proportion of protein,
fat, and carbohydrate in each food, so that it is a simple matter by using
such a table to estimate the proportions of the various nutrients in our
dietary. We may depend upon taking somewhere near the proper amount of food
if we take a diet based upon either Atwater's, Chittenden's, or Voit's
standard. One of the most interesting and useful pieces of home work that
you can do is to estimate your own personal dietary, using the tables
giving the 100-Calorie portion to see if you have a properly balanced diet.
From the table on page <a href="#Page_286">286</a> make out a simple
dietary for yourself for one day, estimating your own needs in Calories and
then picking out 100-Calorie portions of food which will give you the
proper proportions of protein, fat, and carbohydrate.<a name="Page_286"

<p>From the preceding table plan a well-balanced and cheap dietary for one
day for a family of five, two adults and three children. Make a second
dietary for the same time and same number of people which shall give
approximately the same amount of tissue and energy producing food from more
expensive materials.</p>

<p><b>Food Waste in the Kitchen.</b>&mdash;Much loss occurs in the improper
cooking of foods. Meats especially, when overdone, lose much of their
flavor and are far less easily digested than when they are cooked rare. The
chief reasons for cooking meats are that the muscle fibers may be loosened
and softened, and that the bacteria or other parasites in the meat may be
killed by the heat. The common method of frying makes foods less
digestible. Stewing is an economical as well as healthful method. A good
way to prepare meat, either for stew or soup, is to place the meat, cut in
small pieces, in cold water, and allow it to simmer for several hours.
Rapid boiling toughens the muscle fibers by the too rapid coagulation of
the albuminous matter in them, just as the white of egg becomes tough when
boiled too long. Boiling and roasting are excellent methods of cooking
meat. In order to prevent the loss of the nutrients in roasting, it is well
to baste the meat frequently; thus a crust is formed on the outer surface
of the meat, which prevents the escape of the juices from the inside.</p>

<p>Vegetables are cooked in order that the cells containing starch grains
may be burst open, thus allowing the starch to be more <a name="Page_288"
id="Page_288"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>easily attacked by
the digestive fluids. Inasmuch as water may dissolve out nutrients from
vegetable tissues, it is best to boil them rapidly in a small amount of
water. This gives less time for the solvent action to take place.
Vegetables should be cooked with the outer skin left on when it is
possible.</p>

<p><b>Adulterations in Foods.</b>&mdash;The addition of some cheaper
substance to a food, or the subtraction of some valuable substance from a
food, with the view to cheating the purchaser, is known as
<i>adulteration</i>. Many foods which are artificially manufactured have
been adulterated to such an extent as to be almost unfit for food, or even
harmful. One of the commonest adulterations is the substitution of grape
sugar (glucose) for cane sugar. Glucose, however, is not a harmful
adulterant. It is used largely in candy making. Flour and other cereal
foods are sometimes adulterated with some cheap substitutes, as bran or
sawdust. Alum is sometimes added to make flour whiter. Probably the food
which suffers most from adulteration is milk, as water can be added without
the average person being the wiser. By means of an inexpensive instrument
known as a <i>lactometer</i>, this cheat may easily be detected. In most
cities, the milk supply is carefully safeguarded, because of the danger of
spreading typhoid fever from impure milk (see <a href="#Page_296">Chapter
XX</a>). Before the pure food law was passed in 1906, milk was frequently
adulterated with substances like formalin to make it keep sweet longer.
Such preservatives are harmful, and it is now against the law to add
anything whatever to milk.</p>

<p>Coffee, cocoa, and spices are subject to great adulteration; cottonseed
oil is often substituted for olive oil; butter is too frequently
artificial; while honey, sirups of various kinds, cider and vinegar, have
all been found to be either artificially made from cheaper substitutes or
to contain such substitutes.</p>

<p><b>Pure Food Laws.</b>&mdash;Thanks to the National Pure Food and Drug
Law passed by Congress in 1906, and to the activity of various city and
state boards of health, the opportunity to pass adulterated foods on the
public is greatly lessened. This law compels manufacturers of foods or
medicines to state the composition of their products on the labels placed
on the jars or bottles. <a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span>So if a person reads the label he can
determine exactly what he is getting for his money.</p>

<p><b>Impure Water.</b>&mdash;Great danger comes from drinking impure
water. This subject has already been discussed under Bacteria, where it was
seen that the spread of typhoid fever in particular is due to a
contaminated water supply. As citizens, we must aid all legislation that
will safeguard the water used by our towns and cities. Boiling water for
ten minutes or longer will render it safe from all organic impurities.</p>

<p><b>Stimulants.</b>&mdash;We have learned that food is anything that
supplies building material or releases energy in the body; but some
materials used by man, presumably as food, do not come under this head.
Such are tea and coffee. When taken in moderate quantities, <i>they produce
a temporary increase in the vital activities</i> of the person taking them.
This is said to be a stimulation; and material taken into the digestive
tract, producing this, is called a <i>stimulant</i>. In moderation, tea and
coffee appear to be harmless. Some people, however, cannot use either
without ill effects, even in small quantity. It is the <i>habit</i> formed
of relying upon the stimulus given by tea or coffee that makes them a
danger to man. Cocoa and chocolate, although both contain a stimulant, are
in addition good foods, having from 12 per cent to 21 per cent of protein,
from 29 per cent to 48 per cent fat, and over 30 per cent carbohydrate in
their composition.</p>

<p><b>Is Alcohol a Food?</b>&mdash;The question of the use of alcohol has
been of late years a matter of absorbing interest and importance among
physiologists. A few years ago Dr. Atwater performed a series of very
careful experiments by means of the respiration calorimeter, to ascertain
whether alcohol is of use to the body as food.<a name= "fnanchor_40" id=
"fnanchor_40"></a><a href= "#footnote_40" class= "fnanchor">[40]</a> In
these experiments the subjects were given, instead of their daily allotment
of carbohydrates and fats, enough alcohol to supply the same amount of
energy that these foods would have given. The amount was calculated to be
about two and one half ounces per day, about as much as would be contained
in <a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
290]</span>a bottle of light wine.<a name= "fnanchor_41" id=
"fnanchor_41"></a><a href= "#footnote_41" class= "fnanchor">[41]</a> This
alcohol was administered in small doses six times during the day. Professor
Atwater's results may be summed up briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The alcohol administered was almost all oxidized in the body.</p>

<p>2. The potential energy in the alcohol was transformed into heat or
muscular work.</p>

<p>3. The body did about as well with the rations including alcohol as it
did without it.</p>

<p>The committee of fifty eminent men appointed to report on the
physiological aspects of the drink problem reported that a large number of
scientific men state that they are in the habit of taking alcoholic liquor
in small quantities, and many report that they do not <i>feel</i> harm
thereby. A number of scientists seem to agree that within limits alcohol
may be a kind of food, although a very <i>poor</i> food.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we know that although alcohol may technically be
considered as a food, it is a very unsatisfactory food and, as the
following statements show, it has an effect on the body tissues which foods
do not have.</p>

<p>Professor Chittenden of Yale College, in discussing the food problem of
alcohol, writes as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"It is true that alcohol in moderate quantities
may serve as a food, <i>i.e.</i> it can be oxidized with the liberation of
heat. It may to some extent take the place of fat and carbohydrates, but it
is not a perfect substitute for them, and for this reason alcohol has an
action that cannot be ignored. It reduces liver oxidation. It therefore
presents a dangerous side wholly wanting in carbohydrates and fat. The
latter are simply burned up to carbonic acid and water or are transformed
to glycogen and fat, but alcohol, although more easily oxidized, is at all
times liable to obstruct, in a measure at least, the oxidative processes of
the liver and probably of other tissues also, thereby throwing into the
circulation bodies, such as uric acid, which are harmful to health, a fact
which at once tends to draw a distinct line of demarcation between alcohol
and the two non-nitrogenous <a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>foods, fat and carbohydrates. Another matter
must be emphasized, and it is that the form in which alcohol is taken is of
importance. Port wine, for instance, has more influence on the amount of
uric acid secreted than an equivalent amount of alcohol has in some other
form. To conclude: as an adjunct to the ordinary daily diet of the healthy
man alcohol cannot be considered as playing the part of a true
non-nitrogenous food."&mdash;Quoted in <i>American Journal of
Inebriety</i>, Winter, 1906.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol on Living Matter.</b>&mdash;If we examine raw white
of egg, we find a protein which closely resembles protoplasm in its
chemical composition; it is called albumen. Add to a little albumen in a
test tube some 95 per cent alcohol and notice what happens. As soon as the
alcohol touches the albumen the latter coagulates and becomes hard like
boiled white of egg. Shake the alcohol with the albumen and the entire mass
soon becomes a solid. This is because the alcohol draws the water out of
the albumen. It has been shown that albumen is somewhat like protoplasm in
structure and chemical composition. Strong alcohol acts in a similar manner
on living matter when it is absorbed by the living body cells. It draws
water from them and hardens them. It has a chemical and physical action
upon living matter.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol a Poison.</b>&mdash;But alcohol is also in certain quantities
a poison. <i>A commonly accepted definition of a poison is that it is any
substance which, when taken into the body, tends to cause serious detriment
to health, or the death of the organism.</i> That alcohol may do this is
well known by scientists.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge that alcohol taken in small
quantities does not do any <i>apparent</i> harm. But if we examine the
vital records of life insurance companies, we find a large number of deaths
directly due to alcohol and a still greater number due in part to its use.
In the United States every year there are a third more deaths from
alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver (a disease <i>directly</i> caused by
alcohol) than there are from typhoid fever. The poisonous effect is not
found in small doses, but it ultimately shows its harmful effect. Hardening
of the arteries, an old-age disease, is rapidly becoming in this country a
disease of the middle aged. <a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>From it there is no escape. It is chiefly
caused by the cumulative effect of alcohol. The diagram following, compiled
by two English life insurance companies that insure moderate drinkers and
abstainers, shows the death rate to be considerably higher among those who
use alcohol.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Kellogg, the founder of the famous Battle Creek Sanitarium, points
out that strychnine, quinine, and many other drugs are oxidized in the body
but surely cannot be called foods. The following reasons for not
considering alcohol a food are taken from his writings:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">"1. A habitual user of alcohol has an intense craving
for his accustomed dram. Without it he is entirely unfitted for business.
One never experiences such an insane craving for bread, potatoes, or any
other particular article of food.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"2. By continuous use the body acquires a tolerance
for alcohol. That is, the amount which may be imbibed and the amount
required to produce the characteristic effects first experienced gradually
increase until very great quantities are sometimes required to satisfy the
craving which its habitual use often produces. This is never the case with

<p><b>The Use of Tobacco.</b>&mdash;A well-known authority defines a
narcotic as a substance "<i>which directly induces sleep, blunts the
senses, and, in large amounts, produces complete insensibility</i>."
Tobacco, opium, chloral, and cocaine are examples of narcotics. Tobacco
owes its narcotic influence to a strong poison known as nicotine. Its use
in killing insect parasites on plants is well known. In experiments with
jellyfish and other lowly organized animals, the author has found as small
a per cent as one part of nicotine to one hundred thousand parts of sea
water to be sufficient to profoundly affect an animal placed within it. The
illustration here given shows the <a name="Page_294"
id="Page_294"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>effect of nicotine
upon a fish, one of the vertebrate animals. Nicotine in a pure form is so
powerful a poison that two or three drops would be sufficient to cause the
death of a man by its action upon the nervous system, especially the nerves
controlling the beating of the heart. This action is well known among boys
training for athletic contests. The heart is affected; boys become
"short-winded" as a result of the action on the heart. It has been
demonstrated that tobacco has, too, an important effect on muscular
development. The stunted appearance of the young smoker is well known.</p>

<p><b>Use and Abuse of Drugs.</b>&mdash;The American people are addicted to
the use of drugs, and especially patent medicines. A glance at the
street-car advertisements shows this. Most of the medicines advertised
contain alcohol in greater quantity than beer or wine, and many of them
have opium, morphine, or cocaine in their composition. Paregoric and
laudanum, medicines sometimes given to young children, are examples of
dangerous drugs that contain opium. Dr. George D. Haggard of Minneapolis
has shown <a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
295]</span>by many analyses that a large number of the so-called "malts,"
"malt extracts," and "tonics," including several of the best known and most
advertised on the market, are simply disguised beers and, frequently, very
poor beers at that. These drugs, in addition to being harmful, affect the
person using them in such a manner that he soon feels the need for the
drug. Thus the drug habit is formed,&mdash;a condition which has wrecked
thousands of lives. A number of articles on patent medicines recently
appeared in a leading magazine and have been collected and published under
the title of <i>The Great American Fraud</i>. In this booklet the author
points out a number of different kinds of "cures" and patent medicines. The
most dangerous are those headache or neuralgia cures containing
<i>acetanilid</i>. This drug is a heart depresser and should not be used
without medical advice. Another drug which is responsible for habit
formation is <i>cocaine</i>. This is often found in catarrh or other cures.
Alcohol is the basis of all tonics or "bracers." Every boy and girl should
read this booklet so as to be forearmed against evils of the sort just
described.</p>

 alcohol. (See page <a href="#Page_294">294</a>.)</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Purpose of Digestion.</b>&mdash;We have learned that
starch and protein food of plants are formed in the leaves. A plant,
however, is unable to make use of the food in this condition. Before it can
be transported from one part of the plant body to another, it is changed
into a soluble form. In this state it can be passed from cell to cell by
the process of osmosis. Much the same condition exists in animals. In order
that food may be of use to man, it must be changed into a state that will
allow of its passage in a soluble form through the walls of the alimentary
canal, or food tube. <a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>This is done by the enzymes which cause
digestion. It will be the purpose of this chapter to discover where and how
digestion takes place in our own body.</p>

 <i>LI</i>, large intestine; <i>V</i>, appendix; <i>A</i>, anus.</p>
</div>

 <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;In all vertebrate animals, including
 man, food is taken in the mouth and passed through a <i>food tube</i> in
 which it is digested. This tube is composed of different portions, named,
 respectively, as we pass from the <i>mouth</i> downward, the
 <i>gullet</i>, <i>stomach</i>, <i>small</i> and <i>large intestine</i>,
 and <i>rectum</i>.</p>

 <p><b>Comparison of Food Tube of a Frog and Man.</b>&mdash;If we compare
 the food tube of a dissected frog with the food tube of man (as shown by a
 manikin or chart), we find part for part they are much the same. But we
 notice that the intestines of man, both small and large, are relatively
 longer than in the frog. We also notice in man the body cavity or space in
 which the internal organs rest is divided in two parts by a wall of
 muscle, the <i>diaphragm</i>, which separates the heart and lungs from the
 other internal organs. In the frog no muscular diaphragm exists. In the
 frog we can see plainly the silvery transparent <i>mesentery</i> or double
 fold of the lining of the body cavity in which the organs of digestion are
 suspended. Numerous blood vessels can be found especially in the walls of
 the food tube.</p>

 <p><b>Glands.</b>&mdash;In addition to the alimentary canal proper, we
 find a number of <i>digestive glands</i>, varying in size and position,
 connected with the canal.<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a><span
 class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Diagram of a gland. <i>i</i>, the common tube which
 carries off the secretions formed in the cells lining the cavity <i>c</i>;
 <i>a</i>, arteries carrying blood to the glands; <i>v</i>, veins taking
 blood away from the glands.</p> </div>

 <p><b>What a Gland Does. Enzymes.</b>&mdash;In man there are the saliva
 gland of the mouth, the gastric glands of the stomach, the pancreas and
 liver, the two latter connected with the small intestine, and the
 intestinal glands in the walls of the intestine. Besides glands which aid
 in digestion there are several others of which we will speak later. As we
 have already learned, a gland is a collection of cells which takes up
 material from within the body and manufactures from it something which is
 later poured out as a secretion. An example of a gland in plants is found
 in the nectar-secreting cells of a flower.</p>

 <p>Certain substances, called <i>enzymes</i>, formed by glands cause the
 digestion of food. The enzymes secreted by the cells of the glands and
 poured out into the food tube act upon insoluble foods so as to change
 them to a soluble form. They are the product of the activity of the cell,
 although they are not themselves alive. We do not know much about enzymes
 themselves, but we can observe what they do. Some enzymes render soluble
 different foods, others work in the blood, still others probably act
 within any cell of the body as an aid to oxidation, when work is done.
 Enzymes are very sensitive to changes in temperature and to the degree of
 <i>acidity</i> or <i>alkalinity</i><a name= "fnanchor_42" id=
 "fnanchor_42"></a><a href= "#footnote_42" class= "fnanchor">[42]</a> of
 the material in which they act. We will find that the enzymes found in
 glands in the mouth will not act long in the <a name="Page_299"
 id="Page_299"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>stomach because of
 the change from an alkaline surrounding in the mouth to that of an acid in
 the stomach. Enzymes seem to be able to work indefinitely, providing the
 surroundings are favorable. A small amount of digestive fluid, if it had
 long enough to work, could therefore digest an indefinite amount of
 food.</p>

 <p><b>Gland Structure.</b>&mdash;The entire inner surface of the food tube
 is covered with a soft lining of <i>mucous membrane</i>. This is always
 moist because certain cells, called <i>mucus cells</i>, empty out their
 contents into the food tube, thus lubricating its inner surface. When a
 large number of cells which have the power to secrete fluids are collected
 together, the surface of the food tube may become indented at this point
 to form a pitlike <i>gland</i>. Often such depressions are branched, thus
 giving a greater secreting surface, as is seen in the figure on page <a
 href="#Page_298">298</a>. The cells of the gland are always supplied with
 blood vessels and nerves, for the secretions of the glands are under the
 control of the nervous system.</p>

 <p><b>How a Gland Secretes.</b>&mdash;We must therefore imagine that as
 the blood goes to the cells of a gland it there loses some substances
 which the gland cells take out and make over into the particular enzyme
 that they are called upon to manufacture. Under certain conditions, such
 as the sight or smell of food, or even the desire for it, the activity of
 the gland is stimulated. It then pours out its secretion containing the
 digestive enzyme. Thus a gland does its work.</p>

 <p><b>Salivary Glands.</b>&mdash;We are all familiar with the substance
 called <i>saliva</i> which acts as a lubricant in the mouth. Saliva is
 manufactured in the cells of three pairs of glands which empty into the
 mouth, and which are called, according to their position, the
 <i>parotid</i> (beside the ear), the <i>submaxillary</i> (under the
 jawbone), and the <i>sublingual</i> (under the tongue).</p>

 <p><b>Digestion of Starch.</b>&mdash;If we collect some saliva in a test
 tube, add to it a little starch paste, place the tube containing the
 mixture for a few minutes in tepid water, and then test with Fehling's
 solution, we shall find grape sugar present. Careful tests of the starch
 paste and of the saliva made separately will usually show no grape sugar
 in either.</p>

<p>If another test be made for grape sugar, in a test tube containing <a
name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
300]</span>starch paste, saliva, and a few drops of any weak acid, the
starch will be found not to have changed. The digestion or change of starch
to grape sugar is caused by the presence in the saliva of an <i>enzyme</i>,
or <i>digestive ferment</i>. You will remember that starch in the growing
corn grain was changed to grape sugar by an enzyme called <i>diastase</i>.
Here a similar action is caused by an enzyme called <i>ptyalin</i>. This
ferment acts <i>only</i> in an alkaline medium at about the temperature of
the body.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Mouth Cavity in Man.</b>&mdash;In our study of a frog we find that
the mouth cavity has two unpaired and four paired tubes leading from it.
These are (<i>a</i>) the <i>gullet</i> or food tube, (<i>b</i>) the
<i>windpipe</i> (in the frog opening through the <i>glottis</i>),
(<i>c</i>) the paired nostril holes (<i>posterior nares</i>), (<i>d</i>)
the paired <i>Eustachian tubes</i>, leading to the ear. All of these
openings are found in man.</p>

<p>In man the mouth cavity, and all internal surfaces of the food tube, are
lined with a <i>mucous membrane</i>. The <i>mucus</i> secreted from gland
cells in this lining makes a slippery surface so <a name="Page_301"
id="Page_301"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>that the food may
slip down easily. The roof of the mouth is formed in front by a plate of
bone called the <i>hard palate</i>, and a softer continuation to the back
of the mouth, the <i>soft palate</i>. These separate the nose cavity from
that of the mouth proper. The part of the space back of the soft palate is
called the <i>pharynx</i>, or throat cavity. From the pharynx lead off the
<i>gullet</i> and <i>windpipe</i>, the former back of the latter. The lower
part of the mouth cavity is occupied by a muscular tongue. Examination of
its surface with a looking-glass shows it to be almost covered in places by
tiny projections called <i>papillæ</i>. These papillæ contain organs known
as <i>taste buds</i>, the sensory endings of which determine the taste of
substances. The tongue is used in moving food about in the mouth, and in
starting it on its way to the gullet; it also plays an important part in
speaking.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Teeth.</b>&mdash;In man the teeth, unlike those of the frog, are
used in the mechanical preparation of the food for digestion. Instead of
holding prey, they crush, grind, or tear food so that more surface may be
given for the action of the digestive fluids. The teeth of man are divided,
according to their functions, into four groups. In the center of both the
upper and lower jaw in front are found eight teeth with chisel-like edges,
four in each jaw; these are the <i>incisors</i>, or cutting teeth. Next is
found a single tooth on each side (four in all); these have rather sharp
points and are called the <i>canines</i>. Then come two teeth on each side,
eight in <a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
302]</span>all, called <i>premolars</i>. Lastly, the <i>flat-top
molars</i>, or grinding teeth, of which there are six in each jaw. Food is
caught between irregular projections on the surface of the molars and
crushed to a pulpy mass.</p>

<p><b>Hygiene of the Mouth.</b>&mdash;Food should simply be chewed and
relished, with no thought of swallowing. There should be no more effort to
prevent than to force swallowing. It will be found that if you attend only
to the agreeable task of extracting the flavors of your food, Nature will
take care of the swallowing, and this will become, like breathing,
involuntary. The instinct by which most people eat is perverted through the
"hurry habit" and the use of abnormal foods. Thorough mastication takes
time, and therefore one must not feel hurried at meals if the best results
are to be secured. The stopping point for eating should be at the
<i>earliest</i> moment after one is really satisfied.</p>

<p><b>Care of the Teeth.</b>&mdash;It has been recently found that fruit
acids are very beneficial to the teeth. Vinegar diluted to about half
strength with water makes an excellent dental wash. Clean your teeth
carefully each morning and before going to bed. Use dental silk after
meals. We must remember that the bacteria which cause decay of the teeth
are washed down into the stomach and may do even more harm there than in
the mouth.</p>

<p><b>How Food is Swallowed.</b>&mdash;After food has been chewed and mixed
with saliva, it is rolled into little balls and pushed by the tongue into
such position that the muscles of the throat cavity may seize it and force
it downward. Food, in order to reach the gullet from the mouth cavity, must
pass over the opening into the windpipe. When food is in the course of
being swallowed, the upper part of this tube forms a trapdoor over the
opening. When this trapdoor is not closed, and food "goes down the wrong
way," we choke, and the food is expelled by coughing.</p>

 <p class="caption">Peristaltic waves on the gullet of man. (A bolus means
 little ball.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Gullet, or Esophagus.</b>&mdash;Like the rest of the food tube
the gullet is lined by soft and moist mucous membrane. The wall is made up
of two sets of muscles,&mdash;the inside ones running around the tube; the
outer layer of muscle taking a longitudinal course. After food leaves the
mouth cavity, it gets beyond our direct control, and the muscles of the
gullet, stimulated to activity <a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>by the presence of food in the tube, push
the food down to the stomach by a series of contractions until it reaches
the stomach. These wavelike movements (called <i>peristaltic</i> movements)
are characteristic of other parts of the food tube, food being pushed along
in the stomach and the small intestine by a series of slow-moving muscular
waves. Peristaltic movement is caused by muscles which are not under
voluntary nervous control, although anger, fear, or other unpleasant
emotions have the effect of slowing them up or even stopping them
entirely.</p>

<p><b>Stomach of Man.</b>&mdash;The stomach is a pear-shaped organ capable
of holding about three pints. The end opposite to the gullet, which empties
into the small intestine, is provided with a ring of muscle forming a valve
called the <i>pylorus</i>. There is also another ring of muscle guarding
the entrance to the stomach.</p>

<p><b>Gastric Glands.</b>&mdash;If we open the stomach of the frog, and
remove its contents by carefully washing, its wall is seen to be thrown
into folds internally. Between the folds in the stomach of man, as well as
in the frog, are located a number of tiny pits. These form the mouths of
the <i>gastric glands</i>, which pour into the stomach a secretion known as
the <i>gastric juice</i>. The gastric glands are little tubes, the lining
of which secretes the fluid. When we think of or see appetizing food, this
secretion is given out in considerable quantity. The stomach, like the
mouth, "waters" at the sight of food. Gastric juice is slightly acid in its
chemical reaction, containing about .2 per cent free <i>hydrochloric
acid</i>. It also contains two very important enzymes, one called
<i>pepsin</i>, and another less important one called <i>rennin</i>.</p>

<p><b>Action of Gastric Juice.</b>&mdash;If protein is treated with
artificial gastric juice at the temperature of the body, it will be found
to become swollen and then gradually to change to a substance which is
soluble in water. This is like the action of the gastric juice upon
proteins in the stomach.</p>

<p>The other enzyme of gastric juice, called <i>rennin</i>, curdles or
coagulates <a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
304]</span>a protein found in milk; after the milk is curdled, the pepsin
is able to act upon it. "Junket" tablets, which contain rennin, are used in
the kitchen to cause this change.</p>

</div>

<p>The hydrochloric acid found in the gastric juice acts upon lime and some
other salts taken into the stomach with food, changing them so that they
may pass into the blood and eventually form the mineral part of bone or
other tissue. The acid also has a decided antiseptic influence in
preventing growth of bacteria which cause decay, and some of which might
cause disease.</p>

<p><b>Movement of Walls of Stomach.</b>&mdash;The stomach walls, provided
with three layers of muscle which run in an oblique, circular, and
longitudinal direction (taken from the inside outward), are well fitted for
the constant churning of the food in that organ. Here, as elsewhere in the
digestive tract, the muscles are involuntary, muscular action being under
the control of the so-called <i>sympathetic nervous system</i>. Food
material in the stomach makes several complete circuits during the process
of digestion in that organ. Contrary to common belief, the greatest amount
of food is digested <i>after</i> it leaves the stomach. But this organ
keeps the food in it in almost constant motion for a considerable time, a
meal of meat and vegetables remaining in the stomach for three or four
hours. While movement is taking place, the gastric juice acts upon
proteins, softening them, while the constant churning movement tends to
separate the bits of food into finer particles. Ultimately the semifluid
food, much of it still undigested, is allowed to pass in small amounts
through the pyloric valve, into the small intestine. This is allowed by the
relaxation of the ringlike muscles of the pylorus.</p>

<p><b>Experiments on Digestion in the Stomach.</b>&mdash;Some very
interesting experiments have recently been made by Professor Cannon of
Harvard with reference to movements of the stomach contents. Cats were fed
with material having in it bismuth, a harmless <a name="Page_305"
id="Page_305"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>chemical that would
be visible under the X-ray. It was found that shortly after food reached
the stomach a series of waves began which sent the food toward the pyloric
end of the stomach. If the cat was feeling happy and well, these
contractions continued regularly, but if the cat was cross or bad tempered,
the movements would stop. This shows the importance of <i>cheerfulness</i>
at meals. Other experiments showed that food which was churned into a soft
mass was only permitted to leave the stomach when it became thoroughly
permeated by the gastric juice. It is the <i>acid</i> in the partly
digested food that causes the stomach valve to open and allow its contents
to escape little by little into the small intestine.</p>

<p>The partly digested food in the small intestine almost immediately comes
in contact with fluids from two glands, the liver and pancreas. We shall
first consider the function of the pancreas.</p>

<p><b>Position and Structure of the Pancreas.</b>&mdash;The most important
digestive gland in the human body is the pancreas. The gland is a rather
diffuse structure; its duct empties by a common opening with the bile duct
into the small intestine, a short distance below the pylorus. In internal
structure, the pancreas resembles the salivary glands.</p>

 natural grouping of the fat globules. In the circle a single group is
 highly magnified. Milk is one form of an emulsion. (S. M. Babcock, Wis.
 Bul. No. 61.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Work done by the Pancreas.</b>&mdash;Starch paste added to artificial
pancreatic fluid and kept at blood heat is soon changed to sugar. Protein,
under the same conditions, is changed to a peptone. <a name="Page_306"
id="Page_306"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span>Fats, which so far
have been unchanged except to be melted by the heat of the body, are
changed by the action of the pancreas into a form which can pass through
the walls of the food tube. If we test pancreatic fluid, we find it
strongly <i>alkaline</i> in its reaction. If two test tubes, one containing
olive oil and water, the other olive oil and a weak solution of caustic
soda, an <i>alkali</i>, be shaken violently and then allowed to stand, the
oil and water will quickly separate, while the oil, caustic soda, and water
will remain for some time in a milky <i>emulsion</i>. If this emulsion be
examined under the microscope, it will be found to be made of millions of
little droplets of fat, floating in the liquid. The presence of the caustic
soda helped the forming of the emulsion. Pancreatic fluid similarly
emulsifies fats and changes them into soft soaps and fatty acids. Fat in
this form may be absorbed. The process of this transformation is not well
understood.</p>

<p><b>Conditions under which the Pancreas does its Work.</b>&mdash;The
secretion from this gland seems to be influenced by the overflow of acid
material from the stomach. This acid, on striking the lining of the small
intestine, causes the formation in its walls of a substance known as
<i>secretin</i>. This secretin reaches the blood and seems to stimulate all
the glands pouring fluid into the intestine to do more work. A pint or more
of pancreatic fluid is secreted every day.</p>

<p><b>The Intestinal Fluid.</b>&mdash;Three different pancreatic enzymes do
the work of digestion, one acting on starch, another on protein, and a
third on fats. It has been found that some of these enzymes will not do
their work unless aided by the <i>intestinal</i> fluid, a secretion formed
in glands in the walls of the small intestine. This fluid, though not much
is known about it, is believed to play an important part in the digestion
of all kinds of foods left undigested in the small intestine.</p>

<p><b>Liver.</b>&mdash;The liver is the largest gland in the body. In man,
it hangs just below the diaphragm, a little to the right side of the body.
During life, its color is deep red. It is divided into three lobes, between
two of which is found the <i>gall bladder</i>, a thin-walled sac which
holds the <i>bile</i>, a secretion of the liver. Bile is a strongly
alkaline fluid of greenish color. It reaches the intestine through <a
name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span>the
same opening as the pancreatic fluid. Almost one quart of bile is passed
daily into the digestive canal. The color of bile is due to certain waste
substances which come from the destruction of worn-out red corpuscles of
the blood. This destruction takes place in the liver.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Functions of Bile.</b>&mdash;The action of bile is not very well
known. It has the very important faculty of aiding the pancreatic fluid in
digestion, though alone it has slight if any digestive power. Certain
substances in the bile aid especially in the absorption of fats. Bile seems
to be mostly a waste product from the blood and as such incidentally serves
to keep the contents of the intestine in a more or less soft condition,
thus preventing extreme constipation.</p>

<p><b>The Liver a Storehouse.</b>&mdash;Perhaps the most important function
of the liver is the formation within it of a material called
<i>glycogen</i>, or animal starch. The liver is supplied by blood from two
sources. The greater amount of blood received by the liver comes directly
from the walls of the stomach and intestine to this organ. It normally
contains about one fifth of all the blood in the body. This blood is very
rich in food materials, and from it the cells of the liver take out sugars
to form glycogen.<a name= "fnanchor_43" id= "fnanchor_43"></a><a href=
"#footnote_43" class= "fnanchor">[43]</a> Glycogen is stored in the liver
until such a time as a food is needed that can be quickly <a
name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
308]</span>oxidized; then it is changed to sugar and carried off by the
blood to the tissue which requires it, and there used for this purpose.
Glycogen is also stored in the muscles, where it is oxidized to release
energy when the muscles are exercised.</p>

<p><b>The Absorption of Digested Food into the Blood.</b>&mdash;The object
of digestion is to change foods from an insoluble to a soluble form. This
has been seen in the study of the action of the various digestive fluids in
the body, each of which is seen to aid in dissolving solid foods, changing
them to a fluid, and, in case of the bile, actually assisting them to pass
through the wall of the intestine. A small amount of digested food may be
absorbed by the blood in the blood vessels of the walls of the stomach.
Most of the absorption, however, takes place through the walls of the small
intestine.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Structure of the Small Intestine.</b>&mdash;The small
intestine in man is a slender tube nearly twenty feet in length and about
one inch in diameter. If the chief function of the small intestine is that
of absorption, we must look for adaptations which increase the absorbing
surface of the tube. This is gained in part by the inner surface of the
tube being thrown into transverse folds which not only retard the rapidity
with which food passes down the intestine, but also give more absorbing
surface. But far more important for absorption are millions of little
projections which cover the inner surface of the small intestine.</p>

<p><b>The Villi.</b>&mdash;So numerous are these projections that the whole
surface presents a velvety appearance. Collectively, these structures are
called the <i>villi</i> (singular <i>villus</i>). They form the chief
organs of absorption in the intestine, several thousand being distributed
over every square inch of surface. By means of the folds and villi the
small intestine is estimated to have an absorbing surface equal to twice
that of the surface of the body. Between the villi are found the openings
of the <i>intestinal glands</i>.</p>

<p><b>Internal Structure of a Villus.</b>&mdash;The internal structure of a
villus is best seen in a longitudinal section. We find the outer wall made
up of a thin layer of cells, the <i>epithelial</i> layer. It is the duty of
these cells to absorb the semifluid food from within the intestine.
Underneath these cells lies a network of very tiny blood <a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>vessels, while
inside of these, occupying the core of the villus, are found spaces which,
because of their white appearance after absorption of fats, have been
called <i>lacteals</i>. (See figure, page <a href="#Page_307">307</a>.<a name=
"fnanchor_TN6" id= "fnanchor_TN6"></a><a href= "#footnote_TN6" class=
"fnanchor">[TN6]</a>)</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Diagram to show how the nutrients reach the blood.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Absorption of Foods.</b>&mdash;Let us now attempt to find out exactly
how foods are passed from the intestines into the blood. Food substances in
solution may be soaked up as a sponge would take up water, or they may pass
by osmosis into the cells lining the villus. These cells break down the
peptones into a substance that will pass into and become part of the blood.
Once within the villus, the sugars and digested proteins pass through tiny
blood vessels into the larger vessels comprising the <i>portal
circulation</i>. These pass through the liver, where, as we have seen,
sugar is taken from the blood and stored as glycogen. From the liver, the
food within the blood is sent to the heart, from there is pumped to the
lungs, from there returns to the heart, and is pumped to the tissues of the
body. A large amount of water and some salts are also absorbed through the
walls of the stomach and intestine as the food passes on its course. The
fats in the form of soaps and fatty acids pass into the space in the center
of the villus. Later they are changed into fats again, probably in certain
groups of gland cells known as <i>mesenteric</i> glands, and eventually
reach the blood by way of the thoracic duct without passing through the
liver.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Large Intestine.</b>&mdash;The large intestine has
somewhat the same structure as the small intestine, except that it lacks
the villi and has a greater diameter. Considerable absorption, however,
takes place through its walls as the mass of food and refuse material is
slowly pushed along by the muscles within its walls.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Vermiform Appendix.</b>&mdash;At the point where the
small intestine widens to form the large intestine, a baglike pouch is
formed. From one side of <a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span> this pouch is given off a small tube
about four inches long, closed at the lower end. This tube, the rudiment of
what is an important part of the food tube in the lower vertebrates, is
called the <i>vermiform appendix</i>. It has come to have unpleasant
notoriety in late years, as the site of serious inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Constipation.</b>&mdash;In the large intestine live millions of
bacteria, some of which make and give off poisonous substances known as
toxins. These substances are easily absorbed through the walls of the large
intestine, and, when they pass into the blood, cause headaches or sometimes
serious trouble. Hence it follows that the lower bowel should be emptied of
this matter as frequently as possible, at least once a day. Constipation is
one of the most serious evils the American people have to deal with, and it
is largely brought about by the artificial life which we lead, with its
lack of exercise, fresh air, and sleep. Fruit with meals, especially at
breakfast, plenty of water between meals and before breakfast, exercise,
particularly of the abdominal muscles, and regular habits will all help to
correct this evil.</p>

<p><b>Hygienic Habits of Eating; the Causes and Prevention of
Dyspepsia.</b>&mdash;From the contents of the foregoing chapter it is
evident that the object of the process of digestion is to break up solid
food so that it may be absorbed to form part of the blood. Any habits we
may form of thoroughly chewing our food will evidently aid in this process.
Undoubtedly much of the distress known as dyspepsia is due to too hasty
meals with consequent lack of proper mastication of food. The message of
Mr. Horace Fletcher in bringing before us the need of proper mastication of
food and the attendant evils of overeating is one which we cannot afford to
ignore. It is a good rule to go away from the table feeling a little
hungry. Eating too much overtaxes the digestive organs and prevents their
working to the best advantage. Still another cause of dyspepsia is eating
when in a <i>fatigued</i> condition. It is always a good plan to rest a
short time before eating, especially after any hard manual work. We have
seen how great a part unpleasant emotions play in preventing peristaltic
movements of the food tube. Conversely, pleasant conversation, laughter,
and fun will help you to digest your meal. Eating between meals is
condemned by physicians because <a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 311]</span>it calls the blood to the digestive organs
at a time when it should be more active in other parts of the body.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol on Digestion.</b>&mdash;It is a well-known fact
that alcohol extracts water from tissues with which it is in contact. This
fact works much harm to the interior surface of the food tube, especially
the walls of the stomach, which in the case of a hard drinker are likely to
become irritated and much toughened. In very small amounts alcohol
stimulates the secretion of the salivary and gastric glands, and thus
appears to aid in digestion.</p>

<p>The following results of experiments on dogs, published in the
<i>American Journal of Physiology</i>, Vol. I, Professor Chittenden of Yale
University gives as "strictly comparable," because "they were carried out
in succession on the same day." They show that alcohol retards rather than
aids in digestion:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As a result of his experiments, Professor Chittenden remarks: "We
believe that the results obtained justify the conclusion that gastric
digestion as a whole is not materially modified by the introduction of
alcoholic fluids with the food. In other words, the unquestionable
acceleration of gastric secretion which follows the ingestion of alcoholic
beverages is, as a rule, counterbalanced by the inhibitory effect of the
alcoholic fluids upon the chemical <a name="Page_312"
id="Page_312"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span>process of gastric
digestion, with perhaps at times a tendency towards preponderance of
inhibitory action." Others have come to the same or stronger conclusions as
to the undesirable action of alcohol on digestion, as a result of their own
experiments.</p>

"fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>If we examine under the microscope a drop of blood taken from the frog
or man, we find it made up of a fluid called <i>plasma</i> and two kinds of
bodies, the so-called <i>red corpuscles</i> and <i>colorless
corpuscles</i>, floating in this plasma.</p>

<p><b>Composition of Plasma.</b>&mdash;The plasma of blood is found to be
largely (about 90 per cent) water. It also contains a considerable amount
of protein, some sugar, fat, and mineral material. It is, then, the medium
which holds the fluid food that has been absorbed from within the
intestine. This food is pumped to the body cells where, as work is
performed, oxidation takes place and heat is given off as a form of energy.
The almost constant temperature <a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>of the body is also due to the blood, which
brings to the surface of the body much of the heat given off by oxidation
of food in the muscles and other tissues. When the blood returns from the
tissues where the food is oxidized, the plasma brings back with it to the
lungs part of the carbon dioxide liberated where oxidation has taken place.
Some waste products, to be spoken of later, are also found in the
plasma.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Human blood as seen under the high power of the
 compound microscope; at the extreme right is a colorless corpuscle.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Red Blood Corpuscle; its Structure and Functions.</b>&mdash;The
red corpuscle in the blood of the frog is a true cell of disklike form,
containing a nucleus. The red corpuscle of man is made in the red marrow of
bones and in its young stages has a nucleus. In its adult form, however, it
lacks a nucleus. Its form is that of a biconcave disk. So small and so
numerous are these corpuscles that over five million are found in a cubic
centimeter of normal blood. They make up almost one half the total volume
of the blood. The color, which is found to be a dirty yellow when separate
corpuscles are viewed under the microscope, is due to a protein material
called <i>hæmoglobin</i>. Hæmoglobin contains a large amount of iron. It
has the power of uniting very readily with oxygen whenever that gas is
abundant, and, after having absorbed it, of giving it up to the surrounding
media, when oxygen is there present in smaller amounts than in the
corpuscle. This function of carrying oxygen is the most important function
of the red corpuscle, although the red corpuscle also removes part of the
carbon dioxide from the tissues on their return to the lungs. The taking up
of oxygen is accompanied by a change in color of the mass of corpuscles
from a dull red to a bright scarlet.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Clotting of Blood.</b>&mdash;If fresh beef blood is
allowed to stand overnight, it will be found to have separated into two
parts, a dark red, almost solid <i>clot</i> and a thin, straw-colored
liquid called <i>serum</i>. Serum is found to be made up of about 90 per
cent water, 8 per cent protein, 1 per cent <a name="Page_315"
id="Page_315"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span> other organic
foods, and 1 per cent mineral substances. In these respects it very closely
resembles the fluid food that is absorbed from the intestines.</p>

<p class="smaller">If another jar of fresh beef blood is poured into a pan
and briskly whipped with a bundle of little rods (or with an egg beater), a
stringy substance will be found to stick to the rods. This, if washed
carefully, is seen to be almost colorless. Tested with nitric acid and
ammonia, it is found to contain a protein substance which is called
<i>fibrin</i>.</p>

<p>Blood plasma, then, is made up of a fluid portion of serum, and fibrin,
which, although in a fluid state in the blood vessels within the body,
coagulates when blood is removed from the blood vessels. This coagulation
aids in making a blood clot. A clot is simply a mass of fibrin threads with
a large number of corpuscles tangled within. The clotting of blood is of
great physiological importance, for otherwise we might bleed to death even
from a small wound.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Blood Plates.</b>&mdash;In blood within the circulatory system of the
body, the fibrin is held in a fluid state called <i>fibrinogen</i>. An
enzyme, acting upon this fibrinogen, the soluble protein in the blood,
causes it to change to an insoluble form, the fibrin of the clot. This
change seems to be due to the action of minute bodies in the blood known as
<i>blood plates</i>. Under abnormal conditions these blood plates break
down, releasing some substances which eventually cause this enzyme to do
its work.</p>

<p><b>The Colorless Corpuscle; Structure and Functions.</b>&mdash;A
colorless corpuscle is a cell irregular in outline, the shape of which is
constantly changing. These corpuscles are somewhat larger than the red
corpuscles, but less numerous, there being about one colorless corpuscle to
every three hundred red ones. They have the power of movement, for they are
found not only inside but outside the blood vessels, showing that they <a
name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span>have
worked their way between the cells that form the walls of the blood
tubes.</p>

 <p class="caption">A colorless corpuscle catching and eating germs.</p>
</div>

<p>A Russian zoölogist, Metchnikoff, after studying a number of simple
animals, such as medusæ and sponges, found that in such animals some of the
cells lining the inside of the food cavity take up or engulf minute bits of
food. Later, this food is changed into the protoplasm of the cell.
Metchnikoff believed that the colorless corpuscles of the blood have
somewhat the same function. This he later proved to be true. Like the
am&oelig;ba, they feed by engulfing their prey. This fact has a very
important bearing on the relation of colorless corpuscles to certain
diseases caused by bacteria within the body. If, for example, a cut becomes
infected by bacteria, inflammation may set in. Colorless corpuscles at once
surround the spot and attack the bacteria which cause the inflammation. If
the bacteria are few in number, they are quickly eaten by certain of the
colorless corpuscles, which are known as <i>phagocytes</i>. If bacteria are
present in great quantities, they may prevail and kill the phagocytes by
poisoning them. The dead bodies of the phagocytes thus killed are found in
the pus, or matter, which accumulates in infected wounds. In such an event,
we must come to the aid of nature by washing the wound with some
antiseptic, as weak carbolic acid or hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p><b>Antibodies and their Uses.</b>&mdash;In case of disease where, for
example, fever is caused by poison given off from bacteria we find the
cells of the body manufacture and pour into the blood a substance known as
an <i>antibody</i>. This substance does not of necessity kill the harmful
germs or even stop their growth. It does, however, unite with the toxin or
poison given off by the germs and renders it entirely harmless.</p>

<p><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
317]</span><b>Function of Lymph.</b>&mdash;The tissues and organs of the
body are traversed by a network of tubes which carry the blood. Inside
these tubes is the blood proper, consisting of a fluid plasma, the
colorless corpuscles, and the red corpuscles. Outside the blood tubes, in
spaces between the cells which form tissues, is found another fluid, which
is in chemical composition very much like plasma of the blood. This is the
<i>lymph</i>. It is, in fact, fluid food in which some colorless
am&oelig;boid corpuscles are found. Blood gives up its food material to the
lymph. This it does by passing it through the walls of the capillaries. The
food is in turn given up to the tissue cells, which are bathed by the
lymph.</p>

 <p class="caption">The exchange between blood and the cells of the
 body.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the am&oelig;boid corpuscles from the blood make their way
between the cells forming the walls of the capillaries. <i>Lymph, then, is
practically blood plasma plus some colorless corpuscles. It acts as the
medium of exchange between the blood proper and the cells in the tissues of
the body.</i> By means of the food supply thus brought, the cells of the
body are able to grow, the fluid food being changed to the protoplasm of
the cells. By means of the oxygen passed over by the lymph, oxidation may
take place within the cells. Lymph not only gives food to the cells of the
body, but also takes away carbon dioxide and other waste materials, which
are ultimately passed out of the body by means of the lungs, skin, and
kidneys.</p>

<p><b>Internal Secretions.</b>&mdash;In addition to all the functions given
above, the blood has recently been shown to carry the secretions of a
number of glands through which it passes, although these glands <a
name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span>have
no ducts to carry off their secretions. These internal secretions seem
<i>absolutely necessary</i> for the health of the body. Several glands, the
thyroid, adrenal bodies, the testes, and ovaries, as well as the pancreas,
give off these remarkable substances.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>The Amount of Blood and its
Distribution.</b>&mdash;Blood forms, by weight, about one sixteenth of the
body. This would be about four quarts to a body weight of 130 pounds.
Normally, about one half of the blood of the body is found in or near the
organs lying in the body cavity below the diaphragm, about one fourth in
the muscles, and the rest in the head, heart, lungs, large arteries, and
veins.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Blood Temperature.</b>&mdash;The temperature of blood
in the human body is normally about 98.6° Fahrenheit when tested under the
tongue by a thermometer, although the temperature drops almost two degrees
after we have gone to sleep at night. It is highest about 5 P.M. and lowest
about 4 A.M. In fevers, the temperature of the body sometimes rises to
107°; but unless this temperature is soon reduced, death follows. Any
considerable drop in temperature below the normal also means death. Body
heat results from the oxidation of food, and the circulation of blood keeps
the temperature nearly uniform in all parts of the body.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Cold-blooded Animals.</b>&mdash;In animals which are
called cold-blooded, the blood has no fixed temperature, but varies with
the temperature of the medium in which the animal lives. Frogs, in the
summer, may sit for hours in water with a temperature of almost 100°. In
winter, they often endure freezing so that the blood and lymph within the
spaces under the loose skin are frozen into ice crystals. This change in
body temperature is evidently an adaptation to the mode of life.</p>

<p><b>Circulation of the Blood in Man.</b>&mdash;The blood is the carrying
agent of the body. Like a railroad or express company, it takes materials
from one part of the human organism to another. This it does by means of
the organs of circulation,&mdash;the heart and blood vessels. These blood
vessels are called <i>arteries</i> where they carry blood away from the
heart, <i>veins</i> where they bring blood back to the heart, and
<i>capillaries</i> where they connect the larger blood vessels. The organs
of circulation thus form a system of connected tubes through which the
blood flows.</p>

<p><b>The Heart; Position, Size, Protection.</b>&mdash;The heart is a
cone-shaped muscular organ about the size of a man's fist. It is located
immediately above the diaphragm, and lies so that the <a name="Page_319"
id="Page_319"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>muscular apex, which
points downward, moves while beating against the fifth and sixth ribs, just
a little to the left of the midline of the body. This fact gives rise to
the notion that the heart is on the left side of the body. The heart is
surrounded by a loose membranous bag called the <i>pericardium</i>, the
inner lining of which secretes a fluid in which the heart lies. When, for
any reason, the pericardial fluid is not secreted, inflammation arises in
that region.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Internal Structure of Heart.</b>&mdash;If we should cut open the
heart of a mammal down the midline, we could divide it into a right and a
left side, <i>each of which would have no internal connection with the
other</i>. Each side is made up of an upper thin-walled portion with a
rather large internal cavity, the <i>auricle</i>, which opens into a lower
smaller portion with heavy muscular walls, the <i>ventricle</i>.
Communication between auricles and ventricles is guarded by little flaps or
<i>valves</i>. The auricles receive blood from the veins. The ventricles
pump the blood into the arteries.</p>

<p><b>The Heart in Action.</b>&mdash;The heart is constructed on the same
plan as a force pump, the valves preventing the reflux of blood into the
auricle when it is forced out of the ventricle. Blood enters the auricles
from the veins because the muscles of that part of the heart relax; this
allows the space within the auricles to fill. Almost immediately the
muscles of the ventricles relax, thus allowing blood to pass into the
chambers within the ventricles. Then, after a short pause, during which
time the muscles of the heart are resting, a wave of muscular contraction
begins in the auricles and ends in the ventricles, with a sudden strong
contraction which forces the blood out into the arteries. Blood is kept on
its course <a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
320]</span>by the valves, which act in the same manner as do the valves in
a pump. The blood is thus made to pass into the arteries upon the
contraction of the ventricle walls.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Course of the Blood in the Body.</b>&mdash;Although the two sides
of the heart are separate and distinct from each other, yet every drop of
blood that passes through the right heart likewise passes later through the
left heart. There are two distinct systems of circulation in the body. The
<i>pulmonary circulation</i> takes the blood through the right auricle and
ventricle, to the lungs, and passes it back to the left auricle. This is a
relatively short circulation, the blood receiving in the lungs its supply
of oxygen, and there giving up some of its carbon dioxide. The greater
circulation is known as the <i>systemic circulation</i>; in this system,
the blood leaves the left ventricle through the great dorsal <i>aorta</i>.
A large part of the blood passes directly to the muscles; some of it goes
to the nervous system, kidneys, skin, and other organs of the body. It
gives up its supply of food and oxygen in these tissues, receives the waste
products of oxidation while passing through the capillaries, and returns to
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
321]</span><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
322]</span>the right auricle through two large vessels known as the <i>venæ
cavæ</i>. It requires only from twenty to thirty seconds for the blood to
make the complete circulation from the ventricle back again to the starting
point. This means that the entire volume of blood in the human body passes
three or four thousand times a day through the various organs of the
body.<a name= "fnanchor_46" id= "fnanchor_46"></a><a href= "#footnote_46"

<p class="smaller"><b>Portal Circulation.</b>&mdash;Some of the blood, on
its way back to the heart, passes to the walls of the food tube and to its
glands. From there it is sent with its load of absorbed food to the liver.
Here the vein which carries the blood (called the portal vein) breaks up
into capillaries around the cells of the liver, when it gives up sugar to
be stored as glycogen. From the liver, blood passes directly to the right
auricle. The <i>portal circulation</i>, as it is called, is the only part
of the circulation where the blood passes through two sets of capillaries
on its way from auricle to auricle.</p>

<p><b>Circulation in the Web of a Frog's Foot.</b>&mdash;If the web of the
foot of a live frog or the tail of a tadpole is examined under the compound
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
323]</span>microscope, a network of blood vessels will be seen. In some of
the larger vessels the corpuscles are moving rapidly and in spurts; these
are <i>arteries</i>. The arteries lead into smaller vessels hardly greater
in diameter than the width of a single corpuscle. This network of
<i>capillaries</i> may be followed into larger <i>veins</i> in which the
blood moves regularly. This illustrates the condition in any tissue of man
where the arteries break up into capillaries, and these in turn unite to
form veins.</p>

<p><b>Structure of the Arteries.</b>&mdash;A distinct difference in
structure exists between the arteries and the veins in the human body. The
arteries, because of the greater strain received from the blood which is
pumped from the heart, have thicker muscular walls, and in addition are
very elastic.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Cause of the Pulse.</b>&mdash;The <i>pulse</i>, which
can easily be detected by pressing the large artery in the wrist or the
small one in front of and above the external ear, is caused by the gushing
of blood through the arteries after each pulsation of the heart. As the
large arteries pass away from the heart, the diameter of each individual
artery becomes smaller. At the very end of their course, these arteries are
so small as to be almost microscopic in size and are very numerous. There
are so many that if they were placed together, side by side, their united
diameter would be much greater than the diameter of the large artery
(<i>aorta</i>) which passes blood from the left side of the heart. This
fact is of very great importance, for the force of the blood as it gushes
through the arteries becomes very much less when it reaches the smaller
vessels. This gushing movement is quite lost when the capillaries are
reached, first, because there is so much more space for the blood to fill,
and second, because there is considerable friction caused by the very tiny
diameter of the capillaries.</p>

<p><b>Capillaries.</b>&mdash;The capillaries form a network of minute tubes
everywhere in the body, but especially near the surface and in the lungs.
It is through their walls that the food and oxygen pass to the tissues, and
carbon dioxide is given up to the plasma. They form the connection that
completes the system of circulation of blood in the body.</p>

<p><b>Function and Structure of the Veins.</b>&mdash;If the arteries are
supply pipes which convey fluid food to the tissues, then the veins may be
likened to drain pipes which carry away waste material from the <a
name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
324]</span>tissues. Extremely numerous in the extremities and in the
muscles and among other tissues of the body, they, like the branches of a
tree, become larger and unite with each other as they approach the
heart.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 125px">

 <p class="captionj">Valves in a vein. Notice the thin walls of the
 vein.</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller">If the wall of a vein is carefully examined, it will be
found to be neither so thick nor so tough as an artery wall. When empty, a
vein collapses; the wall of an artery holds its shape. If you hold your
hand downward for a little time and then examine it, you will find that the
veins, which are relatively much nearer the surface than are the arteries,
appear to be very much knotted. This appearance is due to the presence of
tiny valves within. These valves open in the direction of the blood
current, but would close if the direction of the blood flow should be
reversed (as in case a deep cut severed a vein). As the pressure of blood
in the veins is much less than in the arteries, the valves thus aid in
keeping the flow of blood in the veins toward the heart. The higher
pressure in arteries and the suction in the veins (caused by the
enlargement of the chest cavity in breathing) are the chief factors which
cause a steady flow of blood through the veins in the body.</p>

<p><b>Lymph Vessels.</b>&mdash;The lymph is collected from the various
tissues of the body by means of a number of very thin-walled tubes, which
are at first very tiny, but after repeated connection with other tubes
ultimately unite to form large ducts. These lymph ducts are provided, like
the veins, with valves. The pressure of the blood within the blood vessels
forces continually more plasma into the lymph; thus a slow current is
maintained. On its course the lymph passes through many collections of
gland cells, the <i>lymph glands</i>. In these glands some impurities
appear to be removed and colorless corpuscles made. The lymph ultimately
passes into a large tube, the <i>thoracic duct</i>, which flows upward near
the ventral side of the spinal column, and empties into the large
subclavian vein in the left side of the neck. Another smaller lymph duct
enters the right subclavian vein.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">

 <p class="captionj">The lymph vessels; the dark spots are lymph glands:
 <i>lac</i>, lacteals; <i>rc</i>, thoracic duct.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Lacteals.</b>&mdash;We have already found that part of the
digested food (chiefly carbohydrates, proteins, salts, and water) is
absorbed <a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
325]</span>directly into the blood through the walls of the villi and
carried to the liver. Fat, however, is passed into the spaces in the
central part of the villi, and from there into other spaces between the
tissues, known as the <i>lacteals</i>. The lacteals carry the fats into the
blood by way of the thoracic duct. The lacteals and lymph vessels have in
part the same course.  It will be thus seen that lymph at different parts
of its course would have a very different composition.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>The Nervous Control of the Heart and Blood
Vessels.</b>&mdash;Although the muscles of the heart contract and relax
without our being able to stop them or force them to go faster, yet in
cases of sudden fright, or after a sudden blow, the heart may stop beating
for a short interval. This shows that the heart is under the control of the
nervous system. Two sets of nerve fibers, both of which are connected with
the central nervous system, pass to the heart. One set of fibers
accelerates, the other slows or inhibits, the heart beat. The arteries and
veins are also under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. This
allows of a change in the diameter of the blood vessels. Thus, blushing is
due to a sudden rush of blood to the surface of the body caused by an
expansion of the blood vessels at the surface. The blood vessels of the
body are always full of blood. This results from an automatic regulation of
the diameter of the blood tubes by a part of the nervous system called the
<i>vasomotor nerves</i>. These nerves act upon the muscles in the walls of
the blood vessels. In this way, each vessel adapts itself to the amount of
blood in it at a given time. After a hearty meal, a large supply of blood
is needed in the walls of the stomach and intestines. At this time, the
arteries going to this region are dilated so as to receive an extra supply.
When the brain performs hard work, blood is supplied in the same manner to
that region. Hence, one should not study or do mental work immediately
after a hearty meal, for blood <a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span>will be drawn away to the brain, leaving the
digestive tract with an insufficient supply. Indigestion may follow as a
result.</p>

<p><b>The Effect of Exercise on the Circulation.</b>&mdash;It is a fact
familiar to all that the heart beats more violently and quickly when we are
doing hard work than when we are resting. Count your own pulse when sitting
quietly, and then again after some brisk exercise in the gymnasium.
Exercise in moderation is of undoubted value, because it sends the
increased amount of blood to such parts of the body where increased
oxidation has been taking place as the result of the exercise. The best
forms of exercise are those which give as many muscles as possible
work&mdash;walking, out-of-door sports, any exercise that is not violent.
Exercise should not be attempted immediately after eating, as this causes a
withdrawal of blood from the digestive tract to the muscles of the body.
Neither should exercise be continued after becoming tired, as poisons are
then formed in the muscles, which cause the feeling we call <i>fatigue</i>.
Remember that extra work given to the heart by extreme exercise may injure
it, causing possible trouble with the valves.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Stopping flow of blood from an artery by applying a
 tight bandage (ligature) between the cut and the heart.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Treatment of Cuts and Bruises.</b>&mdash;Blood which oozes slowly
from a cut will usually stop flowing by the natural means of the formation
of a clot. A cut or bruise should, however, be washed in a weak solution of
carbolic acid or some other antiseptic in order to prevent bacteria from
obtaining a foothold on the exposed flesh. If blood, issuing from a wound,
gushes in distinct pulsations, then we know that an artery has been
severed. To prevent the flow of blood, a tight bandage known as a
<i>tourniquet</i> must be tied between the cut and the heart. <a
name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span>A
handkerchief with a knot placed over the artery may stop bleeding if the
cut is on one of the limbs. If this does not serve, then insert a stick in
the handkerchief and twist it so as to make the pressure around the limb
still greater. Thus we may close the artery until the doctor is called, who
may sew up the injured blood vessel.</p>

<p><b>The Effect of Alcohol upon the Blood.</b>&mdash;It has recently been
discovered that alcohol has an extremely injurious effect upon the
colorless corpuscles of the blood, lowering their ability to fight disease
germs to a marked degree. This is well seen in a comparison of deaths from
certain infectious diseases in drinkers and abstainers, the percentage of
mortality being much greater in the former.</p>

<p>Dr. T. Alexander MacNichol, in a recent address, said:<span
style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">"Massart and Bordet, Metchnikoff and Sims Woodhead,
have proved that alcohol, even in very dilute solution, prevents the white
blood corpuscles from attacking invading germs, thus depriving the system
of the coöperation of these important defenders, and reducing the powers of
resisting disease. The experiments of Richardson, Harley, Kales, and others
have demonstrated the fact that one to five per cent of alcohol in the
blood of the living human body in a notable degree alters the appearance of
the corpuscular elements, reduces the oxygen bearing elements, and prevents
their reoxygenation."</p>

<p><b>Alcohol weakens Resistance to Disease.</b>&mdash;In acute illnesses,
grippe, fevers, blood poisoning, etc., substances formed in the blood
termed "antibodies" antagonize the action of bacteria, facilitating their
destruction by the white blood cells and neutralizing their poisonous
influence. In a person with good "resistance" this protective machinery,
which we do not yet thoroughly understand, works with beautiful precision,
and the patient "gets well." Experiments by scientific experts have
demonstrated that alcohol restrains the formation of these marvelous
antibodies. Alcohol puts to sleep the sentinels that guard your body from
disease.</p>

<p><b>The Effect of Alcohol on the Circulation.</b>&mdash;Alcoholic drinks
affect the very delicate adjustment of the nervous center's<a name=
"fnanchor_TN7" id= "fnanchor_TN7"></a><a href= "#footnote_TN7" class=
"fnanchor">[TN7]</a> controlling <a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span>the blood vessels and heart. Even very
dilute alcohol acts upon the muscles of the tiny blood vessels;
consequently, more blood is allowed to enter them, and, as the small
vessels are usually near the surface of the body, the habitual redness seen
in the face of hard drinkers is the ultimate result.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The first effect of diluted alcohol is to make the
heart beat faster. This fills the small vessels near the surface. A feeling
of warmth is produced which causes the drinker to feel that he was warmed
by the drink. This feeling, however, soon passes away, and is succeeded by
one of chilliness. The body temperature, at first raised by the rather
rapid oxidation of the alcohol, is soon lowered by the increased radiation
from the surface.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The immediate stimulation to the heart's action soon
passes away and, like other muscles, the muscles of the heart lose power
and contract with less force after having been excited by
alcohol."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macy</span>, <i>Physiology</i>.</p>

<p>Alcohol, when brought to act directly on heart muscle, lessens the force
of the beat. It may even cause changes in the tissues, which eventually
result in the breaking of the walls of a blood vessel or the plugging of a
vessel with a blood clot. This condition may cause the disease known as
<i>apoplexy</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Necessity for Respiration.</b>&mdash;We have seen that
plants and animals need oxygen in order that the life processes may go on.
Food is oxidized to release energy, just as coal is burned to give heat to
run an engine. As a draft of air is required to make fire under the boiler,
so, in the human body, oxygen must be given so that food in tissues may be
oxidized to release energy used in work. This oxidation takes place in the
cells of the body, be they part of a muscle, a gland, or the brain.
<i>Blood, in its circulation to all parts of the body, is the medium which
conveys the oxygen to that place in the body where it will be used.</i>

</div>

<p><b>The Organs of Respiration in Man.</b>&mdash;We have alluded to the
fact that the lungs are the organs which give oxygen to the blood and take
from it carbon dioxide. The course of the air passing to the lungs in man
is much the same as in the frog. Air passes through the nose, and into the
windpipe. This cartilaginous tube, the top of which may easily be felt as
the Adam's apple of the throat, divides into two <i>bronchi</i>. The
bronchi within the lungs break up into a great number of smaller tubes, the
<i>bronchial tubes</i>, which divide somewhat like the small branches of a
tree. The bronchial tubes, indeed all the air passages, are lined with
ciliated cells. The cilia of these cells are constantly in motion, beating
with a quick stroke toward the outer end of the tube, that is, toward the
mouth. Hence any foreign material will be raised from the throat first by
the action of the cilia and then by coughing or "clearing the throat." The
bronchi end in very minute air sacs, little pouches having elastic walls,
into which air is taken when we inspire, or take a deep breath. In the
walls of these pouches are numerous capillaries, the ends of arteries which
pass from the heart into the lung. <i>It is through the very thin walls of
the air sacs that an interchange of gases takes place which results in the
blood giving up part of its load of carbon dioxide, and taking up oxygen in
its place.</i> This exchange appears to be aided by the presence of an
enzyme in the lung tissues. This is another example of the various kinds of
work done by the enzymes of the body.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Diagram to show what the blood loses and gains in one
 of the air sacs of the lungs.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Changes in the Blood within the Lungs.</b>&mdash;Blood, after leaving
the lungs, is much brighter red than just before entering them. The change
in color is due to a taking up of oxygen by the <i>hæmoglobin</i> <a
name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span>of
the red corpuscles. Changes taking place in blood are obviously the reverse
of those which take place in air in the lungs. Every hundred cubic
centimeters of blood going into the lungs contains 8 to 12 c.c. of oxygen,
45 to 50 c.c. of carbon dioxide, and 1 to 2 c.c. of nitrogen. The same
amount of blood passing out of the lungs contains 20 c.c. of oxygen, 38
c.c. of carbon dioxide, and 1 to 2 c.c. of nitrogen. The water, of which
about half a pint is given off daily, is mostly lost from the blood.</p>

<p><b>Changes in Air in the Lungs.</b>&mdash;Air is much warmer after
leaving the lungs than before it enters them. Breathe on the bulb of a
thermometer to prove this. Expired air contains a considerable amount of
moisture, as may be proved by breathing on a cold polished surface. This it
has taken up in the air sacs of the lungs. The presence of carbon dioxide
in expired air may easily be detected by the limewater test. Air such as we
breathe out of doors contains, by volume:<span

oxygen, and nearly a corresponding gain in carbon dioxide, in expired air.
There are also some other organic substances present.</p>

 <p class="caption">The respiration of cells.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Cell Respiration.</b>&mdash;It has been shown, in the case of very
simple animals, such as the <i>am&oelig;ba</i>, that when oxidation takes
place in a cell, work results from this oxidation. The oxygen taken into
the lungs is not used there, but is carried by the blood to such parts of
the body as need oxygen to oxidize food materials in the cells. Since work
is done in the cells of the body, food and oxygen are therefore required.
The quantity of oxygen used by the body is nearly dependent on the amount
of work performed. Oxygen is constantly taken from the blood by tissues in
a state of rest and is used up when the body is at work. This is suggested
by the fact that in a given time a man, when working, gives off more oxygen
(in carbon dioxide) than he takes in during that time.</p>

<p>While work is being done certain wastes are formed in the cell. Carbon
dioxide is given off when carbon is burned. But when proteins are burned,
another waste product containing nitrogen is formed. This must be passed
off from the cells, as it is a poison. Here again the lymph and blood, the
common carriers, take the waste material to points where it may be
<i>excreted</i> or passed out of the body.</p>

<p><b>The Mechanics of Respiration. The Pleura.</b>&mdash;The lungs are
covered with a thin elastic membrane, the <i>pleura</i>. This forms a bag
in which the lungs are hung. Between the walls of the bag and the lungs is
a space filled with lymph. By this means the lungs are prevented from
rubbing against the walls of the chest.<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">

 <p class="captionj">The chest cavity (<i>a</i>) at the time of a full
 breath; (<i>b</i>), after an expiration. Explain how the cavity for lungs
 is made larger.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Breathing.</b>&mdash;In every full breath there are two distinct
movements, inspiration (taking air in) and expiration (forcing air out). In
man an inspiration is produced by the contraction of the muscles between
the ribs, together with the contraction of the diaphragm, the muscular wall
just below the heart and lungs; this results in pulling down the diaphragm
and pulling upward and outward of the ribs, thus making the space within
the chest cavity larger. The lungs, which lie within this cavity, are
filled by the air rushing into the larger space thus made. That this cavity
is larger than it was at first may be demonstrated by a glance at the
accompanying figure. An expiration is simpler than an inspiration, for it
requires no muscular effort; the muscles relax, the breastbone and ribs
sink into place, while the diaphragm returns to its original position.</p>

<p class="smaller">A piece of apparatus which illustrates to a degree the
mechanics of breathing may be made as follows: Attach a string to the
middle of a piece of sheet rubber. Tie the rubber over the large end of a
bell jar. Pass a glass Y-tube through a <a name="Page_334"
id="Page_334"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 334]</span>rubber stopper.
Fasten two small toy balloons to the branches of the tube. Close the small
end of the jar with the stopper. Adjust the tube so that the balloons shall
hang free in the jar. If now the rubber sheet is pulled down by means of
the string, the air pressure in the jar is reduced and the toy balloons
within expand, owing to the air pressure down the tube. When the rubber is
allowed to go back to its former position, the balloons collapse.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Diagram showing the relative amounts of tidal,
 complemental, reserve, and residual air. The brace shows the average lung
 capacity for the adult man.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Rate of Breathing and Amount of Air Breathed.</b>&mdash;During quiet
breathing, the rate of inspiration is from fifteen to eighteen times per
minute; this rate largely depends on the amount of physical work performed.
About 30 cubic inches of air are taken in and expelled during the ordinary
quiet respiration. The air so breathed is called <i>tidal air</i>. In a
"long" breath, we take in about 100 cubic inches in addition to the tidal
air. This is called <i>complemental air</i>. By means of a forced
expiration, it is possible to expel from 75 to 100 cubic inches more than
tidal air; this air is called <i>reserve air</i>. What remains in the
lungs, amounting to about 100 cubic inches, is called the <i>residual
air</i>. The value of deep breathing is seen by a glance at the diagram. It
is only by this means that we clear the lungs of the reserve air with its
accompanying load of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Respiration under Nervous Control.</b>&mdash;The
muscular movements which cause an inspiration are partly under the control
of the will, but in part the movement is beyond our control. The nerve
centers which govern inspiration are part of the sympathetic nervous
system. Anything of an irritating nature in the trachea or larynx will
cause a sudden expiration or cough. When a boy runs, the quickened
respiration is due to the fact that oxygen is used up rapidly and a larger
quantity of carbon dioxide is <a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</span>formed. The carbon dioxide in the blood
stimulates the nervous center which has control of respiration to greater
activity, and quickened inspiration follows.</p>

<p><b>Need of Ventilation</b>.&mdash;During the course of a day the lungs
lose to the surrounding air nearly two pounds of carbon dioxide. This means
that about three fifths of a cubic foot is given off by each person during
an hour. When we are confined for some time in a room, it becomes necessary
to get rid of this carbon dioxide. This can be done only by means of proper
ventilation. A considerable amount of moisture is given off from the body,
and this moisture in a crowded room is responsible for much of the
discomfort. The air becomes humid and uncomfortable. It has been found that
by keeping the air in motion in such a room (as through the use of electric
fans) much of this discomfort is obviated.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Three ways of ventilating a room. <i>i</i>, inlet for
 air; <i>o</i>, outlet for air. Which is the best method of ventilation?
 Explain.</p>
</div>

<p>The presence of impurities in the air of a room may easily be determined
by its odor. The odor of a poorly ventilated room is due to organic
impurities given off with the carbon dioxide. This, fortunately, gives us
an index of the amount of waste material in the air. Among the factors
which take oxygen from the air in a closed room and produce carbon dioxide
are burning gas or oil lamps and stoves, and the presence of a number of
people.</p>

<p><b>Proper Ventilation.</b>&mdash;Ventilation consists in the removal of
air that has been used, and the introduction of a fresh supply to take its
place. Heated air rises, carrying with it much of the carbon dioxide and
other impurities. A good method <a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span>of ventilation for the home is to place a
board two or three inches high between the lower sash and the frame of a
window or to have the window open an inch or so at the top and the bottom.
An open fireplace in a room aids in ventilation because of the constant
draft up the flue.</p>

<p><b>Sweeping and Dusting.</b>&mdash;It is very easy to demonstrate the
amount of dust in the air by following the course of a beam of light in a
darkened room. We have already proved that spores of mold and yeast exist
in the air. That bacteria are also present can be proved by exposing a
sterilized gelatin plate to the air in a schoolroom for a few moments.<a

"fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Plate culture exposed for five minutes in a school
 hall where pupils were passing to recitations. Each spot is a colony of
 bacteria or mold.</p>
</div>

<p>Many of the bacteria present in the air are active in causing diseases
of the respiratory tract, such as diphtheria, membranous croup, and
tuberculosis. Other diseases, as colds, bronchitis (inflammation of the
bronchial tubes), and pneumonia (inflammation of the tiny air sacs of the
lungs), are also caused by bacteria.</p>

<p>Dust, with its load of bacteria, will settle on any horizontal surface
in a room not used for three or four hours. Dusting and sweeping should
always be done with a damp cloth or broom, otherwise the bacteria are
simply stirred up and sent into the air <a name="Page_337"
id="Page_337"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 337]</span>again. The proper
watering of streets before they are swept is also an important factor in
health. Much dust is composed largely of dried excreta of animals.
Soft-coal smoke does its share to add to the impurities of the air, while
sewer gas and illuminating gas are frequently found in sufficient
quantities to poison people. Pure air is, as can be seen, almost an
impossibility in a great city.</p>

 width="250" height="236"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">A sleeping porch, an ideal way to get fresh air at
 night.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How to get Fresh Air.</b>&mdash;As we know, green plants give off in
the sunlight considerable more oxygen than they use, and they use up carbon
dioxide. The air in the country is naturally purer than in the city, as
smoke and bacteria are not so prevalent there, and the plants in abundance
give off oxygen. In the city the night air is purer than day air, because
the factories have stopped work, the dust has settled, and fewer people are
on the streets. The old myth of "night air" being injurious has long since
been exploded, and thousands of people of delicate health, especially those
who have weak throat or lungs, are regaining health by sleeping out of
doors or with the windows wide open. The only essential in sleeping out of
doors or in a room with a low temperature is that the body be kept warm and
the head be protected from strong drafts by a nightcap or hood. Proper
ventilation at <i>all</i> times is one of the greatest factors in good
health.</p>

<p><b>Change of Air.</b>&mdash;Persons in poor health, especially those
having tuberculosis, are often cured by a change of air. This is not always
so much due to the composition of the air as to change of occupation, rest,
and good food. Mountain air is dry, and relatively free from dust and
bacteria, and often helps a person having tuberculosis. Air at the seaside
is beneficial for some forms of disease, especially hay fever and bone
tuberculosis. Many sanitariums have been established for this latter
disease near the ocean, and thousands of lives are being annually saved in
this way.<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Unfavorable sleeping conditions. Explain why
 unfavorable.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ventilation of Sleeping Rooms.</b>&mdash;Sleeping in close rooms is
the cause of much illness. Beds ought to be placed so that a constant
supply of fresh air is given without a direct draft. This may often be
managed with the use of screens. Bedroom windows should be thrown open in
the morning to allow free entrance of the sun and air, bedclothes should be
washed frequently, and sheets and pillow covers often changed. Bedroom
furniture should be simple, and but little drapery allowed in the room.</p>

<p><b>Hygienic Habits of Breathing.</b>&mdash;Every one ought to accustom
himself upon going into the open air to inspire slowly and deeply to the
full capacity of the lungs. A slow expiration should follow. Take care to
force the air out. Breathe through the nose, thus warming the air you
inspire before it enters the lungs and chills the blood. Repeat this
exercise several times every day. You will thus prevent certain of the air
sacs which are not often used from becoming hardened and permanently
closed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
339]</span><b>Relation of Proper Exercise to Health.</b>&mdash;We are all
aware that exercise in moderation has a beneficial effect upon the human
organism. The pale face, drooping shoulders, and narrow chest of the boy or
girl who takes no regular exercise is too well known. Exercise, besides
giving direct use of the muscles, increases the work of the heart and
lungs, causing deeper breathing and giving the heart muscles increased
work; it liberates heat and carbon dioxide from the tissues where the work
is taking place, thus increasing the respiration of the tissues themselves,
and aids mechanically in the removal of wastes from tissues. It is well
known that exercise, when taken some little time after eating, has a very
beneficial effect upon digestion. Exercise and especially games are of
immense importance to the nervous system as a means of rest. The increasing
number of playgrounds in this country is due to this acknowledged need of
exercise, especially for growing children.</p>

<p>Proper exercise should be moderate and varied. Walking in itself is a
valuable means of exercising certain muscles, so is bicycling, but neither
is ideal as the <i>only</i> form to be used. <i>Vary</i> your exercise so
as to bring different muscles into play, take exercise that will allow free
breathing out of doors if possible, and the natural fatigue which follows
will lead you to take the rest and sleep that every normal body
requires.</p>

<p>Exercise should always be limited by fatigue, which brings with it
fatigue poisons. This is nature's signal when to rest. If one's use of diet
and air is proper, the fatigue point will be much further off than
otherwise. One should learn to <i>relax</i> when not in activity. The habit
produces rest, even between exertions very close together, and enables one
to continue to repeat those exertions for a much longer time than
otherwise. The habit of lying down when tired is a good one.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Tight Clothing to Correct Breathing.</b>&mdash;It is
impossible to breathe correctly unless the clothing is worn loosely over
the chest and abdomen. Tight corsets and tight belts prevent the walls of
the chest and the abdomen from pushing outward and interfere with the
drawing of air into the lungs. They may also result in permanent distortion
of parts of the skeleton directly <a name="Page_340"
id="Page_340"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 340]</span>under the pressure.
Other organs of the body cavity, as the stomach and intestines, may be
forced downward, out of place, and in consequence cannot perform their work
properly.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Suffocation and Artificial
Respiration.</b>&mdash;Suffocation results from the shutting off of the
supply of oxygen from the lungs. It may be brought about by an obstruction
in the windpipe, by a lack of oxygen in the air, by inhaling some other gas
in quantity, or by drowning. A severe electric shock may paralyze the
nervous centers which control respiration, thus causing a kind of
suffocation. In the above cases, death often may be prevented by prompt
recourse to artificial respiration. To accomplish this, place the patient
on his back with the head lower than the body; grasp the arms near the
elbows and draw them <i>upward</i> and <i>outward</i> until they are
stretched above the head, on a line with the body. By this means the chest
cavity is enlarged and an inspiration produced. To produce an expiration,
carry the arms downward, and press them against the chest, thus forcing the
air out of the lungs. This exercise, regularly repeated every few seconds,
if necessary for hours, has been the source of saving many lives.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>Common Diseases of the Nose and
Throat.</b>&mdash;Catarrh is a disease to which people with sensitive
mucous membrane of the nose and throat are subject. It is indicated by the
constant secretion of mucus from these membranes. Frequent spraying of the
nose and throat with some mild antiseptic solutions is found helpful.
Chronic catarrh should be attended to by a physician. Often we find
children breathing entirely through the mouth, the nose being seemingly
stopped up. When this goes on for some time the nose and throat should be
examined by a physician for <i>adenoids</i>, or growths of soft masses of
tissue which fill up the nose cavity, thus causing a shortage of the air
supply for the body. Many a child, backward at school, thin and irritable,
has been changed to a healthy, normal, bright scholar by the removal of
adenoids. Sometimes the tonsils at the back of the mouth cavity may become
enlarged, thus shutting off the air supply and causing the same trouble as
we see in a case of adenoids. The simple removal of the obstacle by a
doctor soon cures this condition. (See page <a
href="#Page_395">395</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Organs of Excretion.</b>&mdash;All the life processes which take
place in a living thing result ultimately, in addition to giving off of
carbon dioxide, in the formation of organic wastes within the body. The
retention of these wastes which contain nitrogen, is harmful <a
name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</span>to
animals. In man, the skin and kidneys remove this waste from the body,
hence they are called the organs of excretion.</p>

 <p class="caption">Longitudinal section through a kidney.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Human Kidney.</b>&mdash;The human kidney is about four inches
long, two and one half inches wide, and one inch in thickness. Its color is
dark red. If the structure of the medulla and cortex (see figure above) is
examined under the compound microscope, you will find these regions to be
composed of a vast number of tiny branched and twisted tubules. The outer
end of each of these tubules opens into the <i>pelvis</i>, the space within
the kidney; the inner end, in the cortex, forms a tiny closed sac. In each
sac, the outer wall of the tube has grown inward and carried with it a very
tiny artery. This artery breaks up into a mass of capillaries. These
capillaries, in turn, unite to form a small vein as they leave the little
sac. Each of these sacs with its contained blood vessels is called a
<i>glomerulus</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px">

 bringing blood to glomerulus; <i>b'</i>, vessel continuing with blood to
 vein; <i>c</i>, vein; <i>t</i>, tubule; <i>G</i>, glomerulus.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Wastes given off by the Blood in the Kidney.</b>&mdash;In the
glomerulus the blood loses by osmosis, through the very thin walls of the
capillaries, first, a considerable amount of water (amounting to nearly
three pints daily); second, a nitrogenous waste material known as urea;
third, salts and other waste organic substances, uric acid among them.</p>

<p class="smaller">These waste products, together with the water containing
them, are known as <i>urine</i>. The total amount of nitrogenous waste
leaving the body each day is about twenty grams. It <a name="Page_342"
id="Page_342"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</span>is passed through
the <i>ureter</i> to the <i>urinary bladder</i>; from this reservoir it is
passed out of the body, through a tube called the <i>urethra</i>. After the
blood has passed through the glomeruli of the kidneys it is purer than in
any other place in the body, because, before coming there, it lost a large
part of its burden of carbon dioxide in the lungs. After leaving the kidney
it has lost much of its nitrogenous waste. So dependent is the body upon
the excretion of its poisonous material that, in cases where the kidneys do
not do their work properly, death may ensue within a few hours.</p>

<p><b>Structure and Use of Sweat Glands.</b>&mdash;If you examine the palm
of your hand with a lens, you will notice the surface is thrown into little
ridges. In these ridges may be found a large number of very tiny pits;
these are the pores or openings of the sweat-secreting glands. From each
opening a little tube penetrates deep within the epidermis; there, coiling
around upon itself several times, it forms the sweat gland. Close around
this coiled tube are found many capillaries. From the blood in these
capillaries, cells lining the wall of the gland take water, and with it a
little carbon dioxide, urea, and some salts (common salt among others).
This forms the excretion known as <i>sweat</i>. The combined secretions
from these glands amount normally to a little over a pint during <a
name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
343]</span>twenty-four hours. At all times, a small amount of sweat is
given off, but this is evaporated or is absorbed by the underwear; as this
passes off unnoticed, it is called <i>insensible perspiration</i>. In hot
weather or after hard manual labor the amount of perspiration is greatly
increased.</p>

<p><b>Regulation of Heat of the Body.</b>&mdash;The bodily temperature of a
person engaged in manual labor will be found to be but little higher than
the temperature of the same person at rest. We know from our previous
experiments that heat is released. Muscles, nearly one half the weight of
the body, release about five sixths of their energy as heat. At all times
they are giving up some heat. How is it that the bodily temperature does
not differ greatly at such times? The temperature of the body is largely
regulated by means of the activity of the sweat glands. The blood carries
much of the heat, liberated in the various parts of the body by the
oxidation of food, to the surface of the body, where it is lost in the
evaporation of sweat. In hot weather the blood vessels of the skin are
dilated; in cold weather they are made smaller by the action of the nervous
system. The blood thus loses water in the skin, the water evaporates, and
we are cooled off. <i>The object of increased perspiration, then, is to
remove heat from the body.</i> With a large amount of blood present in the
skin, perspiration is increased; with a small amount, it is diminished.
Hence, we have in the skin an automatic regulator of bodily
temperature.</p>

<p><b>Sweat Glands under Nervous Control.</b>&mdash;The sweat glands, like
the other glands in the body, are under the control of the sympathetic
nervous system. Frequently the nerves dilate the blood vessels of the skin,
thus helping the sweat glands to secrete, by giving them more blood.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Thus regulation is carried out by the nervous system
determining, on the one hand, the <i>loss</i> by governing the supply of
blood to the skin and the action of the sweat glands; and on the other, the
<i>production</i> by diminishing or increasing the oxidation of the
tissues."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Foster and Shore</span>,
<i>Physiology</i>.</p>

<p><b>Colds and Fevers.</b>&mdash;The regulation of blood passing through
the blood vessels is under control of the nervous system. If this mechanism
is interfered with in any way, the sweat glands may not <a name="Page_344"
id="Page_344"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</span>do their work,
perspiration may be stopped, and the heat from oxidation held within the
body. The body temperature goes up, and a fever results.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px">

 <p class="caption"><i>A</i>, blood vessels in skin normal;<br /><i>B</i>,
 when congested.</p>
</div>

<p>If the blood vessels in the skin are suddenly cooled when full of blood,
they contract and send the blood elsewhere. As a result a congestion or
cold may follow. Colds are, in reality, a congestion of membranes lining
certain parts of the body, as the nose, throat, windpipe, or lungs.</p>

<p>When suffering from a cold, it is therefore important not to chill the
skin, as a full blood supply should be kept in it and so kept from the seat
of the congestion. For this reason hot baths (which call the blood to the
skin), the avoiding of drafts (which chill the skin), and warm clothing are
useful factors in the care of colds.</p>

<p><b>Hygiene of the Skin.</b>&mdash;The skin is of importance both as an
organ of excretion and as a regulator of bodily temperature. The skin of
the entire body should be bathed frequently so that this function of
excretion may be properly performed. Pride in one's own appearance forbids
a dirty skin. For those who can stand it, a cold sponge bath is best. Soap
should be used daily on parts exposed to dirt. Exercise in the open air is
important to all who desire a good complexion. The body should be kept at
an even temperature by the use of proper underclothing. Wool, a poor
conductor of heat, should be used in winter, and cotton, which allows of a
free escape of heat, in summer.</p>

<p><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
345]</span><b>Cuts, Bruises, and Burns.</b>&mdash;In case the skin is badly
broken, it is necessary to prevent the entrance and growth of bacteria.
This may be done by washing the wound with weak antiseptic solutions such
as 3 per cent <i>carbolic acid</i>, 3 per cent <i>lysol</i>, or <i>peroxide
of hydrogen</i> (full strength). These solutions should be applied
immediately. A burn or scald should be covered at once with a paste of
baking soda, with olive oil, or with a mixture of limewater and linseed
oil. These tend to lessen the pain by keeping out the air and reducing the
inflammation.</p>

<p><b>Summary of Changes in Blood within the Body.</b>&mdash;We have
already seen that red corpuscles in the lungs lose part of their load of
carbon dioxide that they have taken from the tissues, replacing it with
oxygen. This is accompanied by a change of color from purple (in blood
which is poor in oxygen) to that of bright red (in richly oxygenated
blood). Other changes take place in other parts of the body. In the walls
of the food tube, especially in the small intestine, the blood receives its
load of fluid food. In the muscles and other working tissues the blood
gives up food and oxygen, receiving carbon dioxide and organic waste in
return. In the liver, the blood gives up its sugar, and the worn-out red
corpuscles which break down are removed (as they are in the spleen) from
the circulation. In glands, it gives up materials used by the gland cells
in their manufacture of secretions. In the kidneys, it loses water and
nitrogenous wastes (<i>urea</i>). In the skin, it also loses some waste
materials, salts, and water.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"<b>The Effect of Alcohol on Body Heat.</b>&mdash;It
is usually believed that 'taking a drink' when cold makes one warmer. But
such is not the case. In reality alcohol lowers the temperature of the body
by dilating the blood vessels of the skin. It does this by means of its
influence on the nervous system. It is, therefore, a mistake to drink
alcoholic beverages when one is extremely cold, because by means of this
more bodily heat is allowed to escape.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Because alcohol is quickly oxidized, and because
heat is produced in the process, it was long believed to be of value in
maintaining the heat of the body. A different view now prevails as the
result of much observation and experiment. Physiologists show by careful
experiments that though the temperature of the <a name="Page_346"
id="Page_346"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span>body rises during
digestion of food, it is lowered for some hours when alcohol is taken. The
flush which is felt upon the skin after a drink of wine or spirits is due
in part to an increase of heat in the body, but also to the paralyzing
effect of the alcohol upon the capillary walls, allowing them to dilate,
and so permitting more of the warm blood of the interior of the body to
reach the surface. There it is cooled by radiation, and the general
temperature is lowered."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macy</span>,
<i>Physiology</i>.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol on Respiration.</b>&mdash;Alcohol tends to congest
the membrane of the throat and lungs. It does this by paralyzing the nerves
which take care of the tiny blood vessels in the walls of the air tubes and
air sacs. The capillaries become full of blood, the air spaces are
lessened, and breathing is interfered with. The use of alcohol is believed
by many physicians to predispose a person to tuberculosis. Certainly this
disease attacks drinkers more readily than those who do not drink. Alcohol
interferes with the respiration of the cells because it is oxidized very
quickly within the body as it is quickly absorbed and sent to the cells. So
rapid is this oxidation that it interferes with the oxidation of other
substances. Using alcohol has been likened to burning kerosene in a stove;
the operation is a dangerous one.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Tobacco on Respiration.</b>&mdash;Tobacco smoke contains
the same kind of poisons as the tobacco, with other irritating substances
added. It is extremely irritating to the throat; it often causes a cough,
and renders it more liable to inflammation. If the smoke is inhaled more
deeply, the vaporized nicotine is still more readily absorbed and may thus
produce greater irritation in the bronchi and lungs. Cigarettes are worse
than other forms of tobacco, for they contain the same poisons with others
in addition.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol on the Kidneys.</b>&mdash;It is said that alcohol
is one of the greatest causes of disease in the kidneys. The forms of
disease known as "fatty degeneration of the kidney" and "Bright's disease"
are both frequently due to this cause. The kidneys are the most important
organs for the removal of nitrogenous waste.</p>

<p>Alcohol unites more easily with oxygen than most other food <a
name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
347]</span>materials, hence it takes away oxygen that would otherwise be
used in oxidizing these foods. Imperfect oxidation of foods causes the
development and retention of poisons in the blood which it becomes the work
of the kidneys to remove. If the kidneys become overworked, disease will
occur. Such disease is likely to make itself felt as rheumatism or gout,
both of which are believed to be due to waste products (poisons) in the
blood.</p>

<p><b>Poisons produced by Alcohol.</b>&mdash;When too little oxygen enters
the draft of the stove, the wood is burned imperfectly, and there are
clouds of smoke and irritating gases. So, if oxygen unites with the alcohol
and too little reaches the cells, instead of carbon dioxide, water, and
urea being formed, there are other products, some of which are exceedingly
poisonous and which the kidneys handle with difficulty. The poisons
retained in the circulation never fail to produce their poisonous effects,
as shown by headaches, clouded brain, pain, and weakness of the body. The
word "intoxication" means "in a state of poisoning." These poisons
gradually accumulate as the alcohol takes oxygen from the cells. The worst
effects come last, when the brain is too benumbed to judge fairly of their
harm.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Body a Self-directed Machine.</b>&mdash;Throughout the
preceding chapters the body has been likened to an engine, which, while
burning its fuel, food, has done work. If we were to carry our comparison
further, however, the simile ceases. For the engineer runs the engine,
while the bodily machine is self-directive.</p>

<p>Moreover, most of the acts we perform during a day's work are results of
the automatic working of this bodily machine. The heart pumps; the blood
circulates its load of food, oxygen, and wastes; the movements of breathing
are performed; the thousand and one complicated acts that go on every day
within the body are <i>seemingly</i> undirected.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">The central nervous system.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Automatic Activity.</b>&mdash;In addition to this, numbers of other
of our daily acts are not thought about. If we are well-regulated <a
name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</span>body
machines, we get up in the morning, automatically wash, clean our teeth,
dress, go to the toilet, get our breakfast, walk to school, even perform
such complicated processes as that of writing, without <i>thinking</i>
about or <i>directing</i> the machine. In these respects we have become
creatures of habit. Certain acts which once we might have learned
consciously, have become automatic.</p>

<p>But once at school, if we are really making good in our work in the
classroom, we begin a higher control of our bodily functions. Automatic
control acts no longer, and sensation is not the only guide&mdash;for we
now begin to make <i>conscious choice</i>; we weigh this matter against
another,&mdash;in short, we <i>think</i>.</p>

<p><b>Parts of the Nervous System.</b>&mdash;This wonderful self-directive
apparatus placed within us, which is in part under control of our <a
name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
350]</span>will, is known as the nervous system. In the vertebrate animals,
including man, it consists of two divisions. One includes the brain, spinal
cord, the cranial and spinal nerves, which together make up the
<i>cerebro-spinal nervous system</i>. The other division is called the
<i>sympathetic nervous system</i> and has to do with those bodily functions
which are beyond our control. Every group of cells in the body that has
work to do (excepting the floating cells of the blood) is directly
influenced by these nerves. Our bodily comfort is dependent upon their
directive work. The organs which put us in touch with our surroundings are
naturally at the <i>surface</i> of the body. Small collections of nerve
cells, called <i>ganglia</i>, are found in all parts of the body. These
nerve centers are connected, to a greater or less degree, with the surface
of the body by the nerves, which serve as pathways between the end organs
of touch, sight, taste, etc., and the centers in the brain or spinal cord.
Thus sensation is obtained.</p>

<p><b>Sensations and Reactions.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that simpler
forms of life perform certain acts because certain outside forces acting
upon them cause them to <i>react</i> to the stimulus from without. The
one-celled animal responds to the presence of food, to heat, to oxygen, to
other conditions in its surroundings. An earthworm is repelled by light, is
attracted by food. All animals, including man, are put in touch with their
surroundings by what we call the organs of sensation. The senses of man,
besides those we commonly know as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell,
and touch, are those of temperature, pressure, and pain. It is obvious that
such organs, if they are to be of use to an animal, must be at the outside
of the body. Thus we find eyes and ears in the head, and taste cells in the
mouth, while other cells in the nose perceive odors, and still others in
the skin are sensitive to heat or cold, pressure or pain.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Strangely enough, we do not see with our eyes or
taste with our taste cells. These organs receive the sensations, and by
means of a complicated system of greatly elongated cell structures, the
message is sent inward, relayed by other elongated cells until the sensory
message reaches an inner station, in the central nervous system. We see and
hear and smell in our <a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span>brain. Let us next examine the structure of
the nerve cells or <i>neurons</i> part of which serve as pathways for these
messages.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px">
 <img src="images/i355.jpg"
 width="150" height="442"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Diagram of a neuron or nerve unit.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Neurones.</b>&mdash;A nerve cell, like other cells in the body, is a
mass of protoplasm containing a nucleus. But the body of the nerve cell is
usually rather irregular in shape, and distinguished from most other cells
by possessing several delicate, branched protoplasmic projections called
<i>dendrites</i>. One of these processes, the axon, is much longer than the
others and ends in a muscle or organ of sensation. The axon forms the
pathway over which nervous impulses travel to and from the nerve
centers.</p>

<p>A nerve consists of a bundle of such tiny axons, bound together by
connective tissue. As a nerve ganglia is a center of activity in the
nervous system, so a cell body is a center of activity which may send an
impulse over this thin strand of protoplasm (the axon) prolonged many
hundreds of thousands of times the length of the cell. Some neurones in the
human body, although visible only under the compound microscope, give rise
to axons several feet in length.</p>

<p>Because some bundles of axons originate in organs that receive
sensations and send those sensations to the central nervous system, they
are called <i>sensory nerves</i>. Other axons originate in the central
nervous system and pass outward as nerves producing movement of muscles.
These are called <i>motor nerves</i>.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>The Brain of Man.</b>&mdash;In man, the central
nervous system consists of a brain and spinal cord inclosed in a bony case.
From the brain, twelve pairs of nerves are given off; thirty-one pairs more
leave the spinal cord. The brain has three divisions. The <i>cerebrum</i>
makes up the largest part. In this respect it differs from the cerebrum of
the frog and other vertebrates. It is divided into two lobes, the
<i>hemispheres</i>, which are connected with each other by a broad band of
nerve fibers. The outer surface of the <a name="Page_352"
id="Page_352"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 352]</span>cerebrum is thrown
into folds or <i>convolutions</i> which give a large surface, the cell
bodies of the neurons being found in this part of the cerebrum. Holding the
cell bodies and fibers in place is a kind of connective tissue. The inner
part (white in color) is composed largely of fibers which pass to other
parts of the brain and down into the spinal cord. Under the cerebrum, and
dorsal to it, lies the little brain, or <i>cerebellum</i>. The two sides of
the cerebellum are connected by a band of nerve fibers which run around
into the lower hindbrain or <i>medulla</i>. This band of fibers is called
the <i>pons</i>. The medulla is, in structure, part of the spinal cord, and
is made up largely of fibers running longitudinally.</p>

<p class="smaller"><b>The Sympathetic Nervous System.</b>&mdash;Connected
with the central nervous system is that part of the nervous apparatus that
controls the muscles of the digestive tract and blood vessels, the
secretions of gland cells, and all functions which have to do with life
processes in the body. This is called the sympathetic nervous system.</p>

<p><b>Functions of the Parts of the Central Nervous System of the
Frog.</b>&mdash;From careful study of living frogs, birds, and some mammals
we have learned much of what we know of the functions of the parts of the
central nervous system in man.</p>

<p>It has been found that if the entire brain of a frog is destroyed and
separated from the spinal cord, "the frog will continue to live, but with a
very peculiarly modified activity." It does not appear to breathe, nor does
it swallow. It will not move or croak, but if acid is placed upon the skin
so as to irritate it, the legs make movements to push away and to clean off
the irritating substance. The spinal cord is thus shown to be a center for
defensive movements. If the cerebrum is separated from the rest of the
nervous system, the frog seems to act a little differently from the normal
animal. It jumps when touched, and swims when placed in water. It will
croak when stroked, or swallow if food be placed in its mouth. But it
manifests no hunger or fear, and is in every sense a machine which will
perform certain actions after certain stimulations. Its movements are
automatic. If now we watch the movements of a frog which has the brain
uninjured in any way, we find that it acts <i>spontaneously</i>. It tries
to escape when caught. It feels hungry and seeks food. It is capable of
voluntary action. It acts like a normal individual.<a name="Page_353"
id="Page_353"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 353]</span></p>

 the different parts of the brain.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Functions of the Cerebrum.</b>&mdash;In general, the functions of the
different parts of the brain in man agree with those functions we have
already observed in the frog. The cerebrum has to do with conscious
activity; that is, thought. It presides over what we call our thoughts, our
will, and our sensations. A large part of the area of the outer layer of
the cerebrum seems to be given over to some one of the different functions
of speech, hearing, sight, touch, movements of bodily parts. The movement
of the smallest part of the body appears to have its definite localized
center in the cerebrum. Experiments have been performed on monkeys, and
these, together with observations made on persons who had lost the power of
movement of certain parts of the body, and who, after death, were found to
have had diseases localized in certain parts of the cerebrum, have given to
us our knowledge on this subject.</p>

 <p class="caption">Diagram of the nerve path of a simple reflex action.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Reflex Actions; their Meaning.</b>&mdash;If through disease or for
other reasons the cerebrum does not function, no will power is <a
name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
354]</span>exerted, nor are intelligent acts performed. All acts performed
in such a state are known as <i>reflex actions</i>. The involuntary
brushing of a fly from the face, or the attempt to move away from the
source of annoyance when tickled with a feather, are examples of reflexes.
In a reflex act, a person does not think before acting. The nervous impulse
comes from the outside to cells that are not in the cerebrum. The message
is short-circuited back to the surface by motor nerves, without ever having
reached the thinking centers. The nerve cells which take charge of such
acts are located in the cerebellum or spinal cord.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Acts.</b>&mdash;Some acts, however, are learned by
conscious thought, as writing, walking, running, or swimming. Later in
life, however, these activities become automatic. The actual performance of
the action is then taken up by the cerebellum, medulla, and spinal ganglia.
Thus the thinking portion of the brain is relieved of part of its work.</p>

<p><b>Bundles of Habits.</b>&mdash;It is surprising how little real
thinking we do during a day, for most of our acts are habitual. Habit takes
care of our dressing, our bathing, our care of the body organs, our methods
of eating; even our movements in walking and the kind of hand we write are
matters of habit forming. We are bundles of habits, be they good ones or
bad ones.</p>

<p><b>Habit Formation.</b>&mdash;The training of the different areas in the
cerebrum to do their work well is the object of education. When we learned
to write, we exerted conscious effort in order to make the letters. Now the
act of forming the letters is done without thought. By training, the act
has become automatic. In the beginning, a process may take much thought and
many trials <a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
355]</span>before we are able to complete it. After a little practice, the
same process may become almost automatic. We have formed a habit. Habits
are really acquired reflex actions. They are the result of nature's method
of training. The conscious part of the brain has trained the cerebellum or
spinal cord to do certain things that, at first, were taken charge of by
the cerebrum.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Forming Right Habits.</b>&mdash;Among the habits early
to be acquired are the habits of studying properly, of concentrating the
mind, of learning self-control, and, above all, of contentment. Get the
most out of the world about you. Remember that the immediate effect in the
study of some subjects in school may not be great, but the cultivation of
correct methods of thinking may be of the greatest importance later in
life. The man or woman who has learned how to concentrate on a problem, how
to weigh all sides with an unbiased mind, and then to decide on what they
believe to be best and right are the efficient and happy ones of their
generation.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology
tells, is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by
habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young but
realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits, they
would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state. We are
spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every
smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never-so-little scar. The
drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson's play, excuses himself for every
fresh dereliction by saying, 'I won't count this time!' Well! he may not
count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; but it is being counted none
the less. Down among his nerve cells and fibers the molecules are counting
it, registering and storing it up to be used against him when the next
temptation comes. Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific literalness,
wiped out. Of course this has its good side as well as its bad one. As we
become permanent drunkards by so many separate drinks, so we become saints
in the moral, and authorities in the practical and scientific, spheres by
so many separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth have any anxiety
about the upshot of his education, whatever the line of it may be. If he
keep faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may safely leave the
final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count on waking up
some fine morning, to find himself one of the competent ones of his
generation, in whatever pursuit he may have singled out."&mdash;<span

gives several rules for making good or breaking bad habits. They are:
"First, <i>act on every opportunity</i>. Second, <i>make a strong
start</i>. Third, <i>allow no exception</i>. Fourth, <i>for the bad habit
establish a good one</i>. Fifth, summoning all the man within, <i>use
effort of will</i>." Why not try these out in forming some good habit? You

 <p class="captionj">The effect of fatigue on nerve cells. <i>a</i>, healthy
 brain cell; <i>b</i>, fatigued brain cell.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Necessity of Food, Fresh Air, and Rest.</b>&mdash;The nerve cells,
like all other cells in the body, are continually wasting away and being
rebuilt. Oxidation of food material is more rapid when we do mental work.
The cells of the brain, like muscle cells, are not only capable of fatigue,
but show this in changes of form and of contents. <i>Food</i> brought to
them in the blood, plenty of <i>fresh air</i>, especially when engaged in
active brain work, and <i>rest</i> at proper times, are essential in
keeping the nervous system in condition. One of the best methods of resting
the brain cells is a change of occupation. Tennis, golf, baseball, and
other outdoor sports combine muscular exercise with brain activity of a
different sort from that of business or school work. But change of
occupation will not rest exhausted neurones. For this, sleep is necessary.
Especially is sleep an important factor in the health of the nervous system
of growing children.</p>

<p><b>Necessity of Sleep.</b>&mdash;Most brain cells attain their growth
early in life. Changes occur, however, until some time after the school
age. Ten hours of sleep should be allowed for a child, and at least eight
hours for an adult. At this time, only, do the brain cells have opportunity
to rest and store food and energy for their working period.</p>

<p>Sleep is one way in which all cells in the body, and particularly those
of the nervous system, get their rest. The nervous system, by far the most
delicate and hardest-worked set of tissues in the body, needs rest more
than do other tissues, for its work directing <a name="Page_357"
id="Page_357"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 357]</span>the body only ends
with sleep or unconsciousness. The afternoon nap, snatched by the brain
worker, gives him renewed energy for his evening's work. It is not hard
application to a task that wearies the brain; it is <i>continuous</i> work
without rest.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">the senses</span></p>

<p><b>Touch.</b>&mdash;In animals having a hard outside covering, such as
certain worms, insects, and crustaceans, minute hairs, which are sensitive
to touch, are found growing out from the body covering. At the base of
these hairs are found neurones which send axons inward to the central
nervous system.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Nerves in the skin: <i>a</i>, nerve fiber;
 <i>b</i>, tactile papillæ, containing a tactile corpuscle; <i>c</i>,
 papillæ containing blood vessels. (After Benda.)</p>
</div>

<p><b>Organs of Touch.</b>&mdash;In man, the nervous mechanism which
governs touch is located in the folds of the dermis or in the skin. Special
nerve endings, called the <i>tactile corpuscles</i>, are found there, each
inclosed in a sheath or capsule of connective tissue. Inside is a
complicated nerve ending, and axons pass inward to the central nervous
system. The number of tactile corpuscles present in a given area of the
skin determines the accuracy and ease with which objects may be known by
touch.</p>

<p>If you test the different parts of the body, as the back of the hand,
the neck, the skin of the arm, of the back, or the tip of the tongue, with
a pair of open dividers, a vast difference in the accuracy with which the
two points may be distinguished is noticed. On the tip of the tongue, the
two points need only be separated by 1/24 of an inch to be so
distinguished. In the small of the back, a distance of 2 inches may be
reached before the dividers feel like two points.</p>

<p><b>Temperature, Pressure, Pain.</b>&mdash;The feeling of temperature,
pressure, and pain is determined by different end organs in the skin. Two
kinds of nerve fibers exist in the skin, which give distinct sensations of
heat and cold. These nerve endings can be located by careful
experimentation. There are also areas of nerve endings which are sensitive
to pressure, and still others, most numerous of all, sensitive to pain.

 <p class="captionj"><i>A</i>, isolated taste bud, from whose upper free
 end project the ends of the taste cells; <i>B</i>, supporting or
 protecting cell; <i>C</i>, sensory cell.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Taste Organs.</b>&mdash;The surface of the tongue is folded into a
number of little projections known as papillæ. These may be more easily
found on your own tongue if a drop of vinegar is placed on its broad
surface. In the folds, between these projections on the top and back part
of the tongue, are located the organs of taste. These organs are called
<i>taste buds</i>.</p>

<p>Each taste bud consists of a collection of spindle-shaped neurones, each
cell tipped at its outer end with a hairlike projection. These cells send
inward fibers to other cells, the fibers from which ultimately reach the
brain. The sensory cells are surrounded by a number of projecting cells
which are arranged in layers about them. Thus the organ in longitudinal
section looks somewhat like an onion cut lengthwise.</p>

<p><b>How we Taste.</b>&mdash;Four kinds of substances may be distinguished
by the sense of taste. These are sweet, sour, bitter, and salt. Certain
taste cells located near the back of the tongue are stimulated only by a
bitter taste. Sweet substances are perceived by cells near the tip of the
tongue, sour substances along the sides, and salt about equally all over
the surface. A substance must be dissolved in fluid in order to be tasted.
Many things which we believe we taste are in reality perceived by the sense
of smell. Such are spicy sauces and flavors of meats and vegetables. This
may easily be proved by holding the nose and chewing, with closed eyes,
several different substances, such as an apple, an onion, and a raw
potato.</p>

<p><b>Smell.</b>&mdash;The sense of smell is located in the membrane lining
the upper part of the nose. Here are found a large number of rod-shaped
cells which are connected with the brain by means of the olfactory nerve.
In order to perceive odors, it is necessary to have them diffused in the
air; hence we sniff so as to draw in more air over the olfactory cells.</p>

<p><b>The Organ of Hearing.</b>&mdash;The organ of hearing is the ear. The
outer ear consists of a funnel-like organ composed largely of cartilage
which is of use in collecting sound waves. This part of the ear incloses
the auditory canal, which is closed at the inner end by a tightly stretched
membrane, the <i>tympanic membrane</i> or ear drum. The function of the
tympanic membrane is to receive sound waves, for all sound is caused by
vibrations in the air, these vibrations being transmitted, by the means of
a complicated apparatus found in the middle ear, to the real organ of
hearing located in the inner ear.<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span></p>

 <i>Ty.M.</i>, tympanic membrane; <i>Eu.</i>, Eustachian tube; <i>Ty</i>,
 middle ear; <i>Coc.</i>, <i>A.S.C.</i>, <i>E.S.C.</i>, etc., internal
 ear.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Middle Ear.</b>&mdash;The middle ear in man is a cavity inclosed by
the temporal bone, and separated from the outer ear by the tympanic
membrane. A little tube called the <i>Eustachian tube</i> connects the
inner ear with the mouth cavity. By allowing air to enter from the mouth,
the air pressure is equalized on the ear drum. For this reason, we open the
mouth at the time of a heavy concussion and thus prevent the rupture of the
delicate tympanic membrane. Placed directly against the tympanic membrane
and connecting it with the inner ear is a chain of three tiny bones, the
smallest bones of the body. The outermost is called the <i>hammer</i>; the
next the <i>anvil</i>; the third the <i>stirrup</i>. All three bones are so
called from their resemblances in shape to the articles for which they are
named. These bones are held in place by very small muscles which are
delicately adjusted so as to tighten or relax the membranes guarding the
middle and inner ear.</p>

<p><b>The Inner Ear.</b>&mdash;The inner ear is one of the most
complicated, as well as one of the most delicate, organs of the body. Deep
within the temporal bone there are found two parts, one of which is called,
collectively, the <i>semicircular canal region</i>, the other the
<i>cochlea</i>, or organ of hearing.</p>

<p>It has been discovered by experimenting with fish, in which the
semicircular canal region forms the chief part of the ear, that this region
has to do with the equilibrium or balancing of the body. We gain in part
our knowledge of our position and movements in space by means of the
<i>semicircular canals</i>.</p>

<p>That part of the ear which receives sound waves is known as the
<i>cochlea</i>, or snail shell, because of its shape. This very complicated
organ is lined with sensory cells provided with cilia. The cavity of the
cochlea is filled <a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span>with a fluid. It is believed that somewhat
as a stone thrown into water causes ripples to emanate from the spot where
it strikes, so sound waves are transmitted by means of the fluid filling
the cavity to the sensory cells of the cochlea (collectively known as the
<i>organ of Corti</i>) and thence to the brain by means of the auditory
nerve.</p>

<p><b>The Character of Sound.</b>&mdash;When vibrations which are received
by the ear follow each other at regular intervals, the sound is said to be
musical. If the vibrations come irregularly, we call the sound a noise. If
the vibrations come slowly, the pitch of the sound is low; if they come
rapidly, the pitch is high. The ear is able to perceive as low as thirty
vibrations per second and as high as almost thirty thousand. The ear can be
trained to recognize sounds which are unnoticed in untrained ears.</p>

 <p class="caption">Longitudinal section through the eye.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Eye.</b>&mdash;The eye or organ of vision is an almost spherical
body which fits into a socket of bone, the <i>orbit</i>. A stalklike
structure, the <i>optic nerve</i>, connects the eye with the brain. Free
movement is obtained by means of six little muscles which are attached to
the outer coat, the <i>eyeball</i>, and to the bony socket around the
eye.</p>

<p>The wall of the eyeball is made up of three coats. An outer tough white
coat, of connective tissue, is called the <i>sclerotic coat</i>. Under the
sclerotic coat, in front, the eye bulges outward a little. Here the outer
coat is continuous with a transparent tough layer called the <i>cornea</i>.
A second coat, the <i>choroid</i>, is supplied with blood vessels and cells
which bear pigments. It is a part of this coat which we see through the
cornea as the colored part of the eye (the <i>iris</i>). In the center of
the iris is a small circular hole (the <i>pupil</i>). The iris is under the
control of muscles, and may be adjusted to varying amounts of light, the
hole becoming larger in dim light, and smaller in bright light. The inmost
layer of the eye is called the <i>retina</i>. This is, perhaps, the most
delicate layer in the entire body. Despite the fact that the retina is less
than 1/80 of an inch in thickness, there are several layers of cells in its
composition. The optic nerve enters the eye from behind and spreads out to
form the surface of the retina. Its finest fibers are ultimately connected
with numerous elongated cells which are stimulated by light. The retina is
dark purple in color, this color being caused by a layer of cells next to
the choroid coat. This <a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</span>accounts for the black appearance of the
pupil of the eye, when we look through the pupil into the darkened space
within the eyeball. The retina acts as the sensitized plate in the camera,
for on it are received the impressions which are transformed and sent to
the brain as sensations of sight. The eye, like the camera, has a lens.
This lens is formed of transparent, elastic material. It is found directly
behind the iris and is attached to the choroid coat by means of delicate
ligaments. In front of the lens is a small cavity filled with a watery
fluid, the <i>aqueous humor</i>, while behind it is the main cavity of the
eye, filled with a transparent, almost jellylike, <i>vitreous humor</i>.
The lens itself is elastic. This circumstance permits of a change of form
and, in consequence, a change of focus upon the retina of the lens. By
means of this change in form, or <i>accommodation</i>, we are able to
distinguish between near and distant objects.</p>

 <p class="captionj">How far away can you read these letters? Measure the
 distance. Twenty feet is a test for the normal eye.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Defects in the Eye.</b>&mdash;In some eyes, the lens is in focus for
near objects, but is not easily focused upon distant objects; such an eye
is said to be nearsighted. Other eyes which do not focus clearly on objects
near at hand are said to be farsighted. Still another eye defect is
astigmatism, which causes images of lines in a certain direction to be
indistinct, while images of lines transverse to the former are distinct.
Many nervous troubles, especially headaches, may be due to eye strain. We
should have our eyes examined from time to time, especially if we are
subject to headaches.</p>

<p><b>The Alcohol Question.</b>&mdash;It is agreed by investigators that in
large or continued amounts alcohol has a narcotic effect; that it first
dulls or paralyzes the nerve centers which control our judgment, and later
acts upon the so-called motor centers, those which control our muscular
activities.</p>

<p>The reason, then, that a man in the first stages of intoxication talks
rapidly and sometimes wittily, is because the centers of judgment are
paralyzed. This frees the speech centers from control exercised by our
judgment, with the resultant rapid and free flow of speech.</p>

<p>In small amounts alcohol is believed by some physiologists to have
always this same narcotic effect, while other physiologists <a
name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
362]</span>think that alcohol does stimulate the brain centers, especially
the higher centers, to increased activity. Some scientific and professional
men use alcohol in small amounts for this stimulation and report no seeming
harm from the indulgence. Others, and by far the larger number, agree that
this stimulation from alcohol is only apparent and that even in the
smallest amounts alcohol has a narcotic effect.</p>

<p><b>The Paralyzing Effects of Alcohol on the Nervous
System.</b>&mdash;Alcohol has the effect of temporarily paralyzing the
nerve centers. The first effect is that of exhilaration. A man may do more
work for a time under the stimulation of alcohol. This stimulation,
however, is of short duration and is invariably followed by a period of
depression and inertia. In this latter state, a man will do less work than
before. In larger quantities, alcohol has the effect of completely
paralyzing the nerve centers. This is seen in the case of a man "dead
drunk." He falls in a stupor because all of the centers governing speech,
sight, locomotion, etc., have been temporarily paralyzed. If a man takes a
very large amount of alcohol, even the nerve centers governing respiration
and circulation may become poisoned, and the victim will die.</p>

<p><b>Effect on the Organs of Special Sense.</b>&mdash;Professor Forel, one
of the foremost European experts on the question of the effect of alcohol
on the nervous system, says: "Through all parts of nervous activity from
the innervation of the muscles and the simplest sensation to the highest
activity of the soul the paralyzing effect of alcohol can be demonstrated."
Several experimenters of undoubted ability have noted the paralyzing effect
of alcohol even in small doses. By the use of delicate instruments of
precision, Ridge tested the effect of alcohol on the senses of smell,
vision, and muscular sense of weight. He found that two drams of absolute
alcohol produced a positive decrease in the sensitiveness of the nerves of
feeling, that so small a quantity as one half dram of absolute alcohol
diminished the power of vision and the muscular sense of weight. Kraepelin
and Kurz by experiment determined that the acuteness of the special senses
of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell was diminished by an ounce of
alcohol, the power of vision being lost to one third of its extent and a
similar effect <a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 363]</span>being produced on the other special senses.
Other investigators have reached like conclusions. There is no doubt but
that alcohol, even in small quantities, renders the organs of sense less
sensitive and therefore less accurate.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol on the Ability to Resist Disease.</b>&mdash;Among
certain classes of people the belief exists that alcohol in the form of
brandy or some other drink or in patent medicines, malt tonics, and the
like is of great importance in building up the body so as to resist disease
or to cure it after disease has attacked it. Nothing is further from the
truth. In experiments on a large number of animals, including dogs,
rabbits, guinea pigs, fowls, and pigeons, Laitenen, of the University of
Helsingsfors, found that alcohol, without exception, made these animals
more susceptible to disease than were the controls.</p>

<p>One of the most serious effects of alcohol is the lowered resistance of
the body to disease. It has been proved that a much larger proportion of
hard drinkers die from infectious or contagious diseases than from special
diseased conditions due to the direct action of alcohol on the organs of
the body. This <a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 364]</span>lowered resistance is shown in increased
liability to contract disease and increased severity of the disease. We
have already alluded to the findings of insurance companies with reference
to the length of life&mdash;the abstainers from alcohol have a much better
chance of a longer life and much less likelihood of infection by disease
germs.</p>

<p><b>Use of Alcohol in the Treatment of Disease.</b>&mdash;In the London
Temperance Hospital alcohol was prescribed seventy-five times in
thirty-three years. The death rate in this hospital has been lower than
that of most general hospitals. Sir William Collins, after serving nineteen
years as surgeon in this hospital, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">"In my experience, speaking as a surgeon, the use of
alcohol is not essential for successful surgery.... At the London
Temperance Hospital, where alcohol is very rarely prescribed, the mortality
in amputation cases and in operation cases generally is remarkably low.
Total abstainers are better subjects for operation, and recover more
rapidly from accidents, than those who habitually take stimulants."</p>

<p>In a paper read at the International Congress on Tuberculosis, in New
York, 1906, Dr. Crothers remarked that alcohol as a remedy or a preventive
medicine in the treatment of tuberculosis is a most dangerous drug, and
that all preparations of sirups containing spirits increase, rather than
diminish, the disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Kellogg says: "The paralyzing influence of alcohol upon the white
cells of the blood&mdash;a fact which is attested by all
investigators&mdash;is alone sufficient to condemn the use of this drug in
acute or chronic infections of any sort."</p>

<p><b>The Effect of Alcohol upon Intellectual Ability.</b>&mdash;With
regard to the supposed quickening of the mental processes Horsley and
Sturge, in their recent book, <i>Alcohol and the Human Body</i>, say:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Kraepelin found that the simple reaction period, by
which is meant the time occupied in making a mere response to a signal, as,
for instance, to the sudden appearance of a flag, was, after the ingestion
of a small quantity of alcohol (&frac14; to &frac12; ounce), slightly
accelerated; that there was, in fact, a slight shortening of the time, as
though the brain were enabled to operate more quickly than before. <a
name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 365]</span>But
he found that after a few minutes, in most cases, a slowing of mental
action began, becoming more and more marked, and enduring as long as the
alcohol was in active operation in the body, <i>i.e.</i> four to five
hours.... Kraepelin found that it was only more or less automatic work,
such as reading aloud, which was quickened by alcohol, though even this was
rendered less trustworthy and accurate." Again: "Kraepelin had always
shared the popular belief that a small quantity of alcohol (one to two
teaspoonfuls) had an accelerating effect on the activity of his mind,
enabling him to perform test operations, as the adding and subtracting and
learning of figures more quickly. But when he came to measure with his
instruments the exact period and time occupied, he found, to his
astonishment, that he had accomplished these mental operations, not more,
but less, quickly than before.... Numerous further experiments were carried
out in order to test this matter, and these proved that <i>alcohol
lengthens the time taken to perform complex mental processes</i>, while by
a singular illusion the person experimented upon imagines that his
psychical actions are rendered more rapid."<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">

 <p class="caption"> The effect of alcohol upon ability to do mental work.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Attention</i>&mdash;that is, the power of the mind to grasp and
consider impressions obtained through the senses&mdash;is weakened by
drink. The ability of the mind to associate or combine ideas, the faculty
involved in sound <i>judgment</i>, showed that when the persons had taken
the amounts of alcohol mentioned, the combinations of ideas or judgments
expressed by them were confused, foggy, sentimental, and general. When the
persons had taken no alcohol, their judgments were rational, specific,
keen, showing closer observation.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The words of Professor Helmholtz at the celebration
of his seventieth birthday are very interesting in this connection. He
spoke of the ideas flashing up from the depths of the unknown soul, that
lies at the foundation of every truly creative intellectual production, and
closed his account of their origin with these words: 'The smallest quantity
of an alcoholic beverage seemed to frighten these ideas away.'"&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Dr. G. Sims Woodhead</span>, Professor of Pathology,
Cambridge University, England.</p>

<p>Professor Von Bunge (<i>Textbook of Physiological and Pathological
Chemistry</i>) of Switzerland says that:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The stimulating action which alcohol appears to
exert on the brain functions is only a paralytic <a name="Page_367"
id="Page_367"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 367]</span>action. The cerebral
functions which are first interfered with are <i>the power of clear
judgment and reason</i>. No man ever became witty by aid of spirituous
drinks. The lively gesticulations and useless exertions of intoxicated
people are due to paralysis,&mdash;the restraining influences, which
prevent a sober man from uselessly expending his strength, being
removed."</p>

<p><b>The Drink Habit.</b>&mdash;The harmful effects of alcohol (aside from
the purely physiological effect upon the tissues and organs of the body)
are most terribly seen in the formation of the alcohol habit. The first
effect of drinking alcoholic liquors is that of exhilaration. After the
feeling of exhilaration is gone, for this is a temporary state, the subject
feels depressed and less able to work than before he took the drink. To
overcome this feeling, he takes another drink. The result is that before
long he finds a habit formed from which he cannot escape. With body and
mind weakened, he attempts to break off the habit. But meanwhile his will,
too, has suffered from overindulgence. He has become a victim of the drink
habit!</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The capital argument against alcohol, that which
must eventually condemn its use, is this, that <i>it takes away all the
reserved control, the power of mastership, and therefore offends against
the splendid pride in himself or herself, which is fundamental in every man
or woman worth anything</i>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. John
Johnson</span>, quoting Walt Whitman.</p>

<p>Self-indulgence, be it in gratification of such a simple desire as that
for candy or the more harmful indulgence in tobacco or alcoholic beverages,
is dangerous&mdash;not only in its immediate effects on the tissues and
organs, but in its more far-reaching effects on habit formation. Each one
of us is a bundle of appetites. If we gratify appetites of the wrong kind,
we are surely laying the foundation for the habit of excess. Self-denial is
a good thing for each of us to practice at one time or another, if for no
other purpose than to be ready to fight temptation when it comes.</p>

<p><b>The Economic Effect of Alcoholic Poisoning.</b>&mdash;In the struggle
for existence, it is evident that the man whose intellect is the quickest
and keenest, whose judgment is most sound, is the man who is <a
name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 368]</span>most
likely to succeed. The paralyzing effect of alcohol upon the nerve centers
must place the drinker at a disadvantage. In a hundred ways, the drinker
sooner or later feels the handicap that the habit of drink has imposed upon
him. Many corporations, notably several of our greatest railroads (the
Pennsylvania and the New York Central Railroad among them), refuse to
employ any but abstainers in positions of trust. Few persons know the
number of railway accidents due to the uncertain eye of some engineer who
mistook his signal, or the hazy inactivity of the brain of some train
dispatcher who, because of drink, forgot to send the telegram that was to
hold the train from wreck. In business and in the professions, the story is
the same. The abstainer wins out over the drinking man.</p>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol on Ability to do Work.</b>&mdash;In
<i>Physiological Aspects of the Liquor Problem</i>, Professor Hodge,
formerly of Clark University, describes many of his own experiments showing
the effect of alcohol on animals. He trained four selected puppies to
recover a ball thrown across a gymnasium. To two of the dogs he gave food
mixed with doses of alcohol, while the others were fed normally. The ball
was thrown 100 feet as rapidly as recovered. This was repeated 100 times
each day for fourteen successive days. Out of 1400 times the dogs to which
alcohol had been given brought back the ball only 478 times, while the
others secured it 922 times.</p>

<p>Dr. Parkes experimented with two gangs of men, selected to be as nearly
similar as possible, in mowing. He found that with one gang abstaining from
alcoholic drinks and the other not, the abstaining gang could accomplish
more. On transposing the gangs, the same results were repeatedly obtained.
Similar results were obtained by Professor Aschaffenburg of Heidelberg
University, who found experimentally that men "were able to do 15 per cent
less work after taking alcohol."</p>

<p>Recently many experiments along the same lines have been made. In
typewriting, in typesetting, in bricklaying, or in the highest type of
mental work the result is the same. The quality and quantity of work done
on days when alcohol is taken is less than on days when no alcohol is
taken.</p>

<p><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
369]</span><b>The Relation of Alcohol to Efficiency.</b>&mdash;We have
already seen that work is neither so well done nor is as much accomplished
by drinkers as by non-drinkers.</p>

<p>A Massachusetts shoe manufacturer told a recent writer on temperance
that in one year his firm lost over $5000 in shoes spoiled by drinking men,
and that he had himself traced these spoiled shoes to the workmen who,
through their use of alcoholic liquors, had thus rendered themselves
incapable. This is a serious handicap to our modern factory system, and
explains why so many factory towns and cities are strongly favoring a
policy of "No license" in opposition to the saloons.</p>

<p>"It is believed that the largest number of accidents in shops and mills
takes place on Monday, because the alcohol that is drunk on Sunday takes
away the skill and attentive care of the workman. To prove the truth of
this opinion, the accidents of the building trades in Zurich were studied
during a period of six years, with the result shown by this
table":&mdash;</p>

 <p class="caption">Shaded, non-alcoholic; black, alcoholic, accidents.
 (From Tolman, <i>Hygiene for the Worker</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>Another relation to efficiency is shown by the following chart. During
the week the curve of working efficiency is highest on Friday and lowest on
Monday. The number of accidents were also least on Friday and greatest on
Monday. Lastly the assaults were fewest in number on Friday and greatest on
Sunday and Monday. The moral is plain. Workingmen are apt to spend their
week's wages freely on Saturday. Much of this goes into drink, and as a
result comes crime on Sunday because of the deadened moral and <a
name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
370]</span>mental condition of the drinker, and loss of efficiency on
Monday, because of the poisonous effects of the drug.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i374.jpg"
 width="500" height="421"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Notice that the curve of efficiency is lowest on
 Monday and that crimes and accidents are most frequent on Sunday and
 Monday. Account for this.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Effect of Alcohol upon Duration of Life.</b>&mdash;Still more serious
is the relation of alcohol as a direct cause of disease (see table).</p>

<p>It is as yet quite impossible, in the United States at least, to tell
just how many deaths are brought about, directly or indirectly, by alcohol.
Especially is this true in trying to determine the number of cases of
deaths from disease promoted by alcohol. In Switzerland provision is made
for learning these facts, and the records of that country throw some light
on the subject.</p>

<p>Dr. Rudolph Pfister made a study of the records of the city of Basle for
the years 1892-1906, finding the percentage of deaths in which alcohol had
been reported by the attending physician as one cause of death. He found
that 18.1 per cent of all deaths of men <a name="Page_371"
id="Page_371"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 371]</span>between 40 and 50
years of age were caused, in part at least, by alcohol, and this at what
should be the most active period in a man's life, the time when he is most
needed by his family and community. Taking all ages between 20 and 80, he
found that alcohol was one cause of death in one man in every ten who
died.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i375.jpg"
 width="500" height="193"
 alt="Illustration: Swedish study of deaths due to alcohol." />
</div>

<p>Another study was made by a certain doctor in Sweden, from records of
1082 deaths occurring in his own practice and the local hospital. No case
was counted as alcoholic of which there was the slightest doubt. Of deaths
of adult men, 18 in every 100 were due, directly or indirectly, to
alcoholism. In middle life, between the ages of 40 and 50, 29; and between
50 and 60 years of age, 25.6 out of every 100 deaths had alcohol as one
cause, thus agreeing with other statistics we have been quoting.&mdash;From
the <i>Metropolitan</i>, Vol. XXV, Number 11.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i376.jpg"
 width="500" height="231"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">The proportion of crime due to alcohol is shown in
 black.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Relation of Alcohol to Crime.</b>&mdash;A recent study of more
than 2500 habitual users of alcohol showed that over 66 per cent had
committed crime. Usually the crimes had been done in saloons or as a result
of quarrels after drinking. Of another lot of 23,581 criminals questioned,
20,070 said that alcohol had led them to commit crime.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Alcohol to Pauperism.</b>&mdash;We have already
spoken of the Jukes family. These and many other families of a similar sort
are more or less directly a burden upon the state. Alcohol is in part at
least responsible for the condition of such families. Alcohol weakens the
efficiency and moral courage, and thus leads to begging, pauperism, petty
stealing or worse, and ultimately <a name="Page_372"
id="Page_372"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 372]</span>to life in some
public institution. In Massachusetts, of 3230 inmates of such institutions,
66 per cent were alcoholics.</p>

<p><b>The Relation of Alcohol to Heredity.</b>&mdash;Perhaps the gravest
side of the alcohol question lies here. If each one of us had only himself
to think of, the question of alcohol might not be so serious. But drinkers
may hand down to their unfortunate children tendencies toward drink as well
as nervous diseases of various sorts; an alcoholic parent may beget
children who are epileptic, neurotic, or even insane.</p>

<p>In the State of New York there are at the present time some 30,000
insane persons in public and private hospitals. It is believed that about
one fifth of them, or 6000 patients, owe their insanity to alcohol used
either by themselves or by their parents. In the asylums of the United
States there are 150,000 insane people. Taking the same proportions as
before, there are 30,000 persons in this country whom alcohol has made or
has helped to make insane. This is the most terrible side of the alcohol
problem.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Purpose of this Chapter.</b>&mdash;In the preceding
chapters we have traced the lives of both plants and animals within their
own environment. We have seen that man, as well as plants and other
animals, needs a favorable environment in order to live in comfort and
health. It will be the purpose of the following pages first to show how we
as individuals may better our home environment, and secondly, to see how we
may aid the civic authorities in the betterment of conditions in the city
in which we live.<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class=
"pagenum">[Pg 374]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i378.jpg"
 width="250" height="220"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">How I should ventilate my bedroom.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Home Conditions.&mdash;The Bedroom.</b>&mdash;We spend about one
third of our total time in our bedroom. This room, therefore, deserves more
than passing attention. First of all, it should have good ventilation. Two
windows make an ideal condition, especially if the windows receive some
sun. Such a condition as this is manifestly impossible in a crowded city,
where too often the apartment bedrooms open upon narrow and ill-ventilated
courts. Until comparatively recent time, tenement houses were built so that
the bedrooms had practically no light or air; now, thanks to good
tenement-house laws, wide airshafts and larger windows are required by
statute.</p>

<p><b>Care of the Bedroom.</b>&mdash;Since sunlight cannot always be
obtained for a bedroom, we must so care for and furnish the room that it
will be difficult for germs to grow there. Bedroom furniture should be
light and easy to clean, the bedstead of iron, the floors painted or of
hardwood. No hangings should be allowed at the windows to collect dust, nor
should carpets be allowed for the same reason. Rugs on the floor may easily
be removed when cleaning is done. The furniture and woodwork should be
wiped with a damp cloth every day. Why a <i>damp</i> cloth? In certain
tenements in New York City, tuberculosis is believed to have been spread by
people occupying rooms in which a previous tenant has had tuberculosis. A
new tenant should insist on a thorough cleaning of the bedrooms and removal
of old wall paper before occupancy.</p>

<p><b>Sunlight Important.</b>&mdash;In choosing a house in the country we
would take a location in which the sunlight was abundant. A shaded location
might be too damp for health. Sunlight should enter at least some of the
rooms. In choosing an apartment we should have this matter in mind, for, as
we know, germs cannot long exist in sunlight.<a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">
</a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 375]</span></p>

 width="500" height="657"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">This map shows how cases of tuberculosis are found
 recurring in the same locality and in the same houses year after year.
 Each black dot is one case of tuberculosis.
</p>
</div>

<p><b>Heating.</b>&mdash;Houses in the country are often heated by open
fires, stoves or hot-air furnaces, all of which make use of heated currents
of air to warm the rooms. But in the city apartments, usually pipes conduct
steam or hot water from a central plant to our rooms. The difficulty with
this system is that it does not give us <a name="Page_376"
id="Page_376"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 376]</span>fresh air, but warms
over the stale air in a room. Steam causes our rooms to be too warm part of
the time, and not warm enough part of the time. Thus we become overheated
and then take cold by becoming chilled. Steam heat is thus responsible for
much sickness.</p>

<p><b>Lighting.</b>&mdash;Lighting our rooms is a matter of much
importance. A student lamp, or shaded incandescent light, should be used
for reading. Shades must be provided so that the eyes are protected from
direct light. Gas is a dangerous servant, because it contains a very
poisonous substance, carbon monoxide. "It is estimated that 14 per cent of
the total product of the gas plant leaks into the streets and houses of the
cities supplied." This forms an unseen menace to the health in cities. Gas
pipes, and especially gas cocks, should be watched carefully for escaping
gas. Rubber tubing should not be used to conduct gas to movable gas lamps,
because it becomes worn and allows gas to escape.</p>

 width="500" height="230"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">During the summer all food should be protected from
 flies. Why?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Insects and Foods.</b>&mdash;In the summer our houses should be
provided with screens. All food should be carefully protected from flies.
Dirty dishes, scraps of food, and such garbage should be quickly cleaned up
and disposed of after a meal. Insect powder (pyrethrum) will help keep out
"croton bugs" and other undesirable household pests, but cleanliness will
do far more. Most kitchen pests, as the roach, simply stay with us because
they find dirt and food abundant.</p>

<p><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
377]</span><b>Use of Ice.</b>&mdash;Food should be properly cared for at
all times, but especially during the summer. Iceboxes are a necessity,
especially where children live, in order to keep milk fresh. A dirty icebox
is almost as bad as none at all, because food will decay or take on
unpleasant odors from other foods.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px">
 <img src="images/i381.jpg"
 width="300" height="412"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">The wrong and the right kind of garbage cans.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Disposal of Wastes.</b>&mdash;In city houses the disposal of human
wastes is provided for by a city system of sewers. The wastes from the
kitchen, the garbage, should be disposed of each day. The garbage pail
should be frequently sterilized by rinsing it with boiling water. Plenty of
lye or soap should be used. Remember that flies frequent the uncovered
garbage pail, and that they may next walk on your food. Collection and
disposal of garbage is the work of the municipality.</p>

<p><b>School Surroundings.&mdash;How to Improve Them.</b>&mdash;From five
to six hours a day for forty weeks is spent by the average boy or girl in
the schoolroom. It is part of our environment and should therefore be
considered as worthy of our care. Not only should a schoolroom be
attractive, but it should be clean and sanitary. City schools, because of
their locations, of the sometimes poor janitorial service, and especially
because of the selfishness and carelessness of children who use them, may
be very dirty and unsanitary. Dirt and dust breed and carry bacteria. Plate
cultures show greatly increased numbers of bacteria to be in the air when
pupils are moving about, for then dust, bearing bacteria, is stirred up <a
name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 378]</span>and
circulated through the air. Sweeping and dusting with dry brooms or feather
dusters only stirs up the dust, leaving it to settle in some other place
with its load of bacteria. Professor Hodge tells of an experience in a
school in Worcester, Mass. A health brigade was formed among the children,
whose duty was to clean the rooms every morning by wiping all exposed
surface with a damp cloth. In a school of 425 pupils not a single case of
contagious diseases appeared during the entire year. Why not try this in
your own school?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i382.jpg"
 width="500" height="256"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">The culture (<i>A</i>) was exposed to the air of a
 dirty street in the crowded part of Manhattan. (<i>B</i>) was exposed to
 the air of a well-cleaned and watered street in the uptown residence
 portion. Which culture has the more colonies of bacteria? How do you
 account for this?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Unselfishness the Motto.</b>&mdash;Pupils should be unselfish in the
care of a school building. Papers and scraps dropped by some careless boy
or girl make unpleasant the surroundings for hundreds of others. Chalk
thrown by some mischievous boy and then tramped underfoot may irritate the
lungs of a hundred innocent schoolmates. Colds or worse diseases may be
spread through the filthy habits of some boys who spit in the halls or on
the stairways.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Time and Lunches.</b>&mdash;If you bring your own lunch to
school, it should be clean, tasty, and well balanced as a ration. In most
large schools well-managed lunch rooms are part of the school <a
name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
379]</span>equipment, and balanced lunches can be obtained at low cost. Do
not make a lunch entirely from cold food, if hot can be obtained. Do not
eat only sweets. Ice cream is a good food, if taken with something else,
but be sure of your ice cream. "Hokey pokey" cream, tested in a New York
school laboratory, showed the presence of many more colonies of bacteria
than <i>good</i> milk would show. Above all, be sure the food you buy is
clean. Stands on the street, exposed to dust and germs, often sell food far
from fit for human consumption.</p>

 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">A sensible lunch box, sanitary and compact.</p>
</div>

<p>If you eat your lunch on the street near your school, remember not to
scatter refuse. Paper, bits of lunch, and the like scattered on the streets
around your school show lack of school spirit and lack of civic pride. Let
us learn above all other things to be good citizens.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Dust exhausts on grinding wheels protect lungs of the
 workmen.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Inspection of Factories, Public Buildings, etc.</b>&mdash;It is the
duty of a city to inspect the condition of all public buildings and
especially of factories. Inspection should include, first, the supervision
of the work undertaken. Certain trades where grit, dirt, or poison fumes
are given off are dangerous to human health, hence care for the workers
becomes a necessity. Factories should also be inspected as to cleanliness,
the amount of air space per person employed, ventilation, toilet
facilities, and proper fire protection. Tenement inspection should be
thorough and should aim to provide safe and sanitary homes.</p>

<p><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
380]</span><b>Inspection of Food Supplies.</b>&mdash;In a city certain
regulations for the care of public supplies are necessary. Foods, both
fresh and preserved, must be inspected and rendered safe for the thousands
of people who are to use them. All raw foods exposed on stands should be
covered so as to prevent insects or dust laden with bacteria from coming in
contact with them. Meats must be inspected for diseases, such as
tuberculosis in beef, or trichinosis in pork. Cold storage plants must be
inspected to prevent the keeping of food until it becomes unfit for use.
Inspection of sanitary conditions of factories where products are canned,
or bakeries where foods are prepared, must be part of the work of a city in
caring for its citizens.</p>

<p><b>Care of Raw Foods.</b>&mdash;Each one of us may coöperate with the
city government by remembering that fruits and vegetables can be carriers
of disease, especially if they are sold from exposed stalls or carts and
handled by the passers-by. All vegetables, fruits, or raw foods should be
carefully washed before using. Spoiled or overripe fruit, as well as meat
which is decayed, is swarming with bacteria and should not be used.</p>

<p>An interesting exercise would be the inspection of conditions in your
own home block. Make a map showing the houses on the block. Locate all
stores, saloons, factories, etc. Notice any cases of contagious disease,
marking this fact on the map. Mark all heaps of refuse in the street, all
uncovered garbage pails, any street stands that sell uncovered fruit, and
any stores with an excessive number of flies.</p>

<p>In addition to food inspection, two very important supplies must be
rendered safe by a city for its citizens. These are milk and water.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px">
 <img src="images/i384.jpg"
 width="300" height="233"
 alt="" />
 <p class="captionj">Clean cows in clean barns with clean milkers and clean
 milk pails means clean milk in the city.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Care in Production of Milk.</b>&mdash;Milk when drawn from a healthy
cow should <a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
381]</span>be free from bacteria. But immediately on reaching the air it
may receive bacteria from the air, from the hands of the person who milks
the cows, from the pail, or from the cow herself. Cows should, therefore,
be milked in surroundings that are sanitary, the milkers should wear clean
garments, put on over their ordinary clothes at milking time, while pails
and all utensils used should be kept clean. Especially the surface exposed
on the udder from which the milk is drawn should be cleansed before
milking.</p>

<p>Most large cities now send inspectors to the farms from which milk is
supplied. Farms that do not accept certain standards of cleanliness are not
allowed to have their milk become part of the city supply.</p>

<p><b>Tuberculosis and Milk.</b>&mdash;It is recognized that in some
European countries from 30 to 40 per cent of all cattle have tuberculosis.
Many dairy herds in this country are also infected. It is also known that
the tubercle bacillus of cattle and man are much alike in form and action
and that <i>probably</i> the germ from cattle would cause tuberculosis in
man. Fortunately, the tuberculosis germ does not <i>grow</i> in milk, so
that even if milk from tubercular cattle should get into our supply, it
would be diluted with the milk of healthy cattle. In order to protect our
milk supply from these germs it would be necessary to kill all tubercular
cattle (almost an impossibility) or to pasteurize our milk so as to kill
the germs in it.</p>

<p><b>Other Disease Germs in Milk.</b>&mdash;We have already shown how
typhoid may be spread through milk. Usually such outbreaks may be traced to
a single case of typhoid, often a person who is a "typhoid carrier,"
<i>i.e.</i> one who may not suffer from the effects of the disease, but who
carries the germs in his body, spreading them by contact. A recent epidemic
of typhoid in New York City was traced to a single typhoid carrier on a
farm far from the city. Sometimes the milk cans may be washed in
contaminated water or the cows may even get the germs on their udders by
wading in a polluted stream. Diphtheria, scarlet fever, and Asiatic cholera
are also undoubtedly spread through milk supplies. Milk also plays a very
important part in the high death rate from diarrh&oelig;al diseases among
young children in warm weather. Why?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">

 <p class="captionj">A diagram to show how typhoid may be spread in a city

 of typhoid. <i>A</i>, a farm where typhoid exists; the dashes in the
 streets represent the milk route. <i>B</i> is a second farm which sends
 part of its milk to <i>A</i>; the milk cans from <i>B</i> are washed at
 farm <i>A</i> and sent back to <i>B</i>. A few cases of typhoid appear
 along <i>B</i>'s milk route. How do you account for that?</p>
</div>

<p><b>Grades of Milk in a City Supply.</b>&mdash;Milk which comes to a city
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
382]</span>may be roughly placed in three different classes. The best milk,
coming from farms where the highest sanitary standards exist, where the
cows are all tubercular tested, where modern appliances for handling and
cooling the milk exist, is known as certified or, in New York City, grade A
milk. Most of the milk sold, however, is not so pure nor is so much care
taken in handling it. Such milk, known in New York as grade B milk, is
pasteurized before delivery, and is sold only in bottles. A still lower
grade of milk (dipped milk) is sold direct from cans. It is evident that
such milk, often exposed to dust and other dirt, is unfit for any purpose
except for cooking. It should under no circumstances be used for children.
A regulation recently made by the New York City <a name="Page_383"
id="Page_383"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 383]</span>Department of Health
states that milk sold "loose" in restaurants, lunch-rooms, soda fountains,
and hotels must be pasteurized.</p>

<p><b>Care of a City Milk Supply.</b>&mdash;Besides caring for milk in its
production on the farm, proper transportation facilities must be provided.
Much of the milk used in New York City is forty-eight hours old before it
reaches the consumer. During shipment it must be kept in refrigerator cars,
and during transit to customers it should be iced. Why? All but the highest
grade milk should be pasteurized. Why? Milk should be bottled by machinery
if possible so as to insure no personal contact; it should be kept in
clean, cool places; and no milk should be sold by dipping from cans. Why is
this a method of dispensing impure milk?</p>

<p><b>Care of Milk in the Home.</b>&mdash;Finally, milk at home should
receive the best of care. It should be kept on ice and in covered bottles,
because it readily takes up the odors of other foods. If we are not certain
of its purity or keeping qualities, it should be pasteurized at home.
Why?</p>

 and abundant water supply. This is the tunnel which will bring the water
 from the Catskill Mountains to New York City.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Water Supplies.</b>&mdash;One of the greatest assets to the health of
a large city is pure water. By pure water we mean water free from all
<i>organic</i> impurities, including germs. Water from springs and deep
driven wells is the safest water, that from large reservoirs next best,
while water that has drainage in it, river water for example, is very
unsafe.</p>

<p>The waters from deep wells or springs if properly <a name="Page_384"
id="Page_384"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</span>protected will
contain no bacteria. Water taken from protected streams into which no
sewage flows will have but few bacteria, and these will be destroyed if
exposed to the action of the sun and the constant aëration (mixing with
oxygen) which the surface water receives in a large lake or reservoir. But
water taken from a river into which the sewage of other towns and cities
flows must be filtered before it is fit for use.</p>

 two weeks later cases began to appear in Lowell until a great epidemic

</div>

<p>Typhoid fever germs live in the food tube, hence the excreta of a
typhoid patient will contain large numbers of germs. In a city with a
system of sewage such germs might eventually pass from the sewers into a
river. Many cities take their water supply directly from rivers, sometimes
not far below another large town. Such cities must take many germs into
their water supply. Many cities, as Cleveland and Buffalo, take their water
from lakes into which their sewage flows. Others, as Albany, Pittsburgh,
and Philadelphia, take their drinking water directly from rivers into which
<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
385]</span>sewage from cities above them on the river has flowed. Filtering
such water by means of passing the water through settling basins and sand
filters removes about 98 per cent of the germs. The result of drinking
unfiltered and filtered water in certain large cities is shown graphically
at right. In cities which drain their sewage into rivers and lakes, the
question of sewage disposal is a large one, and many cities now have means
of disposing of their sewage in some manner as to render it harmless to
their neighbors.</p>

<p>Railroads are often responsible for carrying typhoid and spreading it.
It is said that a recent outbreak of typhoid in Scranton, Pa., was due to
the fact that the excreta from a typhoid patient traveling in a sleeping
car was washed by rain into a reservoir near which the train was passing.
Railroads are thus seen to be great open sewers. A sanitary car toilet is
the only remedy.<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a><span

<p><b>Sewage Disposal.</b>&mdash;Sewage disposal is an important sanitary
problem for any city. Some cities, like New York, pour their sewage
directly into rivers which flow into the ocean. Consequently much of the
liquid which bathes the shores of Manhattan Island is dilute sewage. Other
cities, like Buffalo or Cleveland, send their sewage into the lakes from
which they obtain their supply of drinking water. Still other cities which
are on rivers are forced to dispose of their sewage in various ways. Some
have a system of <a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 387]</span>filter beds in which the solid wastes are
acted upon by the bacteria of decay, so that they can be collected and used
as fertilizer. Others precipitate or condense the solid materials in the
sewage and then dispose of it. Another method is to flow the sewage over
large areas of land, later using this land for the cultivation of crops.
This method is used by many small European cities.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Work of the Department of Street Cleaning.</b>&mdash;In any city
a menace to the health of its citizens exists in the refuse and garbage.
The city streets, when dirty, contain countless millions of germs which
have come from decaying material, or from people ill with disease. In most
large cities a department of street cleaning not only cares for the removal
of dust from the streets, but also has the removal of garbage, ashes, and
other waste as a part of its work. The disposal of solid wastes is a
tremendous task. In Manhattan the dry wastes are estimated to be 1,000,000
tons a year in addition to about 175,000 tons of garbage. Prior to 1895 in
the city of New York garbage was not separated from ashes; now the law
requires that garbage be placed in separate receptacles from ashes. Do you
see why? The street-cleaning department should be aided by every citizen;
rules for the separation of garbage, papers, and ashes should be kept.
Garbage and ash cans should be <i>covered</i>. The practice of upsetting
ash or garbage cans is one which no young citizen should allow in his
neighborhood, for sanitary reasons. The best results in summer street
cleaning are obtained by washing or flushing the streets, for thus the dirt
containing germs is prevented from getting into the air. The garbage is
removed in carts, and part of it is burned in huge furnaces. The animal and
plant refuse is cooked in great tanks; from this material the fats are
extracted, and the solid matter is sold for fertilizer. Ashes are used for
filling marsh land. Thus the removal of waste matter may pay for itself in
a large city.<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

 <p class="captionj">The upper picture shows the stables where
 millions of flies were bred; the lower picture, the disinfection
 of manure so as to prevent the breeding of flies.</p>
</div>

<p><b>An Experiment in Civic Hygiene.</b>&mdash;During the summer of 1913
an interesting experiment on the relation of flies and filth to disease was
carried on in New York City by the Bureau of Public Health and Hygiene of
the New York Association for improving the condition of the poor. Two
adjoining blocks were chosen in a thickly populated part of the Bronx near
a number of stables which were the sources of great numbers of flies. In
one block all houses were screened, garbage pails were furnished with
covers, refuse was removed and the surroundings made as sanitary as
possible. In the adjoining block conditions were left unchanged. During the
summer as flies began to breed in the manure heaps near the stables all
manure was disinfected. Thus the breeding of flies was checked. The
campaign of education was continued during the summer by means of moving
pictures, nurses, boy scouts, and school children who became
interested.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer it was found that there had been a considerable
decrease in the number of cases of fly-carried diseases and a still greater
decrease in the total days of sickness (especially of children) in the
screened and sanitary block. The table and <a name="Page_389"
id="Page_389"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</span>pictures speak for
themselves. If such a small experiment shows results like this, then what
might a general clean-up of a city show?</p>

 garbage from the fire escape. She was a foreigner and knew no better. The
 picture below shows the result of such garbage disposal.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Public Hygiene.</b>&mdash;Although it is absolutely necessary for
each individual to obey the laws of health if he or she wishes to keep
well, it has also become necessary, especially in large cities, to have
general supervision over the health of people living in a community. This
is done by means of a department or board of health. It is the function of
this department to care for public health. In addition to such a body in
cities, supervision over the health of its citizens is also exercised by
state boards of health. But as yet the government of the United States has
not established a Bureau of Health, important as such a bureau would
be.</p>

<p><b>The Functions of a City Board of Health.</b>&mdash;The administration
of the Board of Health in New York City includes a number of divisions,
each of which has a different work to do. Each is in itself important, and,
working together, the entire machine provides ways and means for making the
great city a safe and sanitary place in which to live. Let us take up the
work of each division <a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span
class="pagenum">[Pg 390]</span>of the health board in order to find out how
we may coöperate with them.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Comparison of cases of illness during the summer of
 1913 in two city blocks, one clean and the other dirty. What are your
 conclusions?</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Division of Infectious Diseases.</b>&mdash;Infectious diseases
are chiefly spread through <i>personal contact</i>. It is the duty of a
government to prevent a person having such a disease from spreading it
broadcast among his neighbors. This can be done by <i>quarantine</i> or
<i>isolation</i> of the person having the disease. So the board of health
at once isolates any case of disease which may be communicated from one
person to another. No one save the doctor or nurse should enter the room of
the person quarantined. After the disease has run its course, the clothing,
bedding, etc., in the sick room is fumigated. This is usually done by the
board of health. Formaldehyde in the form of candles for burning or in a
liquid form is a good disinfectant. In disinfecting the room should be
tightly closed to prevent the escape of the gas used, as the object of the
disinfection is to kill all the disease germs left in the room. In some
cases of infectious disease, as scarlet fever, it is found best to isolate
the patients in a hospital used for that purpose. Examples of the most
infectious diseases are measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and
diphtheria.</p>

<p><b>Immunity.</b>&mdash;In the prevention of germ diseases we must fight
the germ by attacking the parasites directly with poisons that will kill
them (such poisons are called <i>germicides</i> or <i>disinfectants</i>),
and we must strive to make the persons coming in contact with the disease
unlikely to take it. This insusceptibility or <i>immunity</i> may <a
name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 391]</span>be
either natural or acquired. Natural immunity seems to be in the
constitution of a person, and may be inherited. Immunity may be acquired by
means of such treatment as the antitoxin treatment for diphtheria. This
treatment, as the name denotes, is a method of neutralizing the poison
(toxin) caused by the bacteria in the system. It was discovered a few years
ago by a German, Von Behring, that the serum of the blood of an animal
immune to diphtheria is capable of neutralizing the poison produced by the
diphtheria-causing bacteria. Horses are rendered immune by giving them the
diphtheria toxin in gradually increasing doses. The serum of the blood of
these horses is then used to inoculate the patient suffering from or
exposed to diphtheria, and thus the disease is checked or prevented
altogether by the antitoxin injected into the blood. The laboratories of
the board of health prepare this antitoxin and supply it fresh for public
use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px">
 <img src="images/i395.jpg"
 width="400" height="156"
 alt="" />
 <p class="caption">Antitoxin for diphtheria prepared by the New York Board of Health.</p>
</div>

<p>It has been found from experience in hospitals that deaths from
diphtheria are largely preventable by <i>early use</i> of antitoxin. When
antitoxin was used on the first day of the disease no deaths took place. If
not used until the second day, 5 deaths occurred in every hundred cases, on
the third day 11 deaths, on the 4th day 19 deaths, and on the 5th day 20
deaths out of every hundred cases. It is therefore advisable, in a
suspected case of diphtheria, to have antitoxin used at once to prevent
serious results.</p>

<p><b>Vaccination.</b>&mdash;Smallpox was once the most feared disease in
this country; 95 per cent of all people suffered from it. As late <a
name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 392]</span>as
1898, over 50,000 persons lost their lives annually in Russia from this
disease. It is probably not caused by bacteria, but by a tiny animal
parasite. Smallpox has been brought under absolute control by
vaccination,&mdash;the inoculation of man with the substance (called
<i>virus</i>) which causes cowpox in a cow. Cowpox is like a mild form of
smallpox, and the introduction of this virus gives complete immunity to
smallpox for several years after vaccination. This immunity is caused by
the formation of a germicidal substance in the blood, due to the
introduction of the virus. Another function of the board of health is the
preparation and distribution of vaccine (material containing the virus of
cowpox).</p>

<p><b>Rabies (Hydrophobia).</b>&mdash;This disease, which is believed to be
caused by a protozoan parasite, is communicated from one dog to another in
the saliva by biting. In a similar manner it is transferred to man. The
great French bacteriologist, Louis Pasteur, discovered a method of treating
this disease so that when taken early at the time of the entry of the germ
into the body of man, the disease can be prevented. In some large cities
(among them New York) the board of health has established a laboratory
where free treatment is given to all persons bitten by dogs suspected of
having rabies.</p>

<p><b>Vaccination against Typhoid.</b>&mdash;Typhoid fever has within the
past five years received a new check from vaccination which has been
introduced into our army and which is being used with good effect by the
health departments of several large cities.</p>

<p>The following figures show the differences between number of cases and
mortality in the army in 1898 during the war with Spain and in 1911 during
the concentration of certain of our troops at San Antonio, Texas.</p>

 <p class="captionj">Comparison of cases of and death from typhoid in 1898
 and 1911. What have we learned about combating typhoid since 1898?</p>
</div>

<p>During this period there were 49 cases of typhoid and 19 deaths in the
near-by city of San Antonio. But in camp, <i>where vaccination for typhoid
was required</i>, all were practically immune. In the army at large, since
typhoid vaccination has been practiced, 1908-1909, the death rate from
typhoid has dropped from 2.9 per 1000 to .03 per 1000, a wonderful record
when we remember that during the Spanish-American War 86 per cent of the
deaths in the army were from typhoid fever.</p>

<p><b>How the Board of Health fights Tuberculosis.</b>&mdash;Tuberculosis,
which a few years ago killed fully one seventh of the people who died from
disease in this country, now kills less than one tenth. This decrease has
been largely brought about because of the treatment of the disease. Since
it has been proved that tuberculosis if taken early enough is curable, by
quiet living, good food, and <i>plenty</i> of fresh air and light, we find
that numerous sanitaria have come into existence which are supported by
private or public means. At these sanitaria the patients <i>live</i> out of
doors, especially sleep in the air, while they have plenty of nourishing
food and little exercise. The department of health of New York City
maintains <a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
394]</span>a sanitarium at Otisville in the Catskill Mountains. Here people
who are unable to provide means for getting away from the city are cared
for at the city's expense and a large percentage of them are cured. In this
way and by tenement house laws which require proper air shafts and window
ventilation in dwellings, by laws against spitting in public places, and in
other ways, the boards of health in our towns and cities are waging war on
tuberculosis.</p>

<p><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
395]</span> Ex-President Roosevelt said, in one of his latest messages to
Congress:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">"There are about 3,000,000 people seriously ill in
the United States, of whom 500,000 are consumptives. <i>More than half of
this illness is preventable.</i> If we count the value of each life lost at
only $1700 and reckon the average earning lost by illness at $700 a year
for grown men, we find that the economic gain from mitigation of
preventable disease in the United States would exceed $1,500,000,000 a
year. This gain can be had through medical investigation and practice,
school and factory hygiene, restriction of labor by women and children, the
education of the people in both public and private hygiene, and through
improving the efficiency of our health service, municipal, state, and
national."</p>

<p><b>Work of the Division of School and Infant Hygiene.</b>&mdash;Besides
the work of the division of infectious disease, the division of sanitation,
which regulates the general sanitary conditions of houses and their
surroundings and the division of inspection, which looks after the purity
and conditions of sale and delivery of milk and foods, there is another
department which most vitally concerns school children. This is the
division of school and infant hygiene. The work of this department is that
of the care of the children of the city. During the year 1912, 279,776
visits were made to the homes of school children of the city of New York by
inspectors and nurses. Besides this, thousands of children in school were
cared for and aided by the city.</p>

<p><b>Adenoids.</b>&mdash;Many children suffer needlessly from
adenoids,&mdash;growths in the back of the nose or mouth which prevent
sufficient oxygen being admitted to the lungs. A child suffering from these
growths is known as a "mouth breather" because the mouth is opened in order
to get more air. The result to the child may be a handicap of deafness,
chronic running of the nose, nervousness, and lack of power to think. His
body cells are starving for oxygen. A very simple operation removes this
growth. Coöperation on the part of the children and parents with the
doctors or nurses of the board of health will do much in removing this
handicap from many young lives.</p>

<p><b>Eyestrain.</b>&mdash;Another handicap to a boy or girl is eyestrain.
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
396]</span>Twenty-two per cent of the school children of Massachusetts were
recently found to have defects in vision. Tests for defective eyesight may
be made at school easily by competent doctors, and if the child or parent
takes the advice given to correct this by procuring proper glasses, a
handicap on future success will be removed.</p>

<p><b>Decayed Teeth.</b>&mdash;Decayed teeth are another handicap, cared
for by this division. Free dental clinics have been established in many
cities, and if children will do their share, the chances of their success
in later life will be greatly aided. Boys and girls, if handicapped with
poor eyes or teeth, do not have a fair chance in life's competition. In a
certain school in New York City there were 236 pupils marked "C" in their
school work. These children were examined, and 126 were found to have bad
teeth, 54 defective vision, and 56 other defects, as poor hearing,
adenoids, enlarged tonsils, etc. Of these children 185 were treated for
these various difficulties, and 51 did not take treatment. During the
following year's work 176 of these pupils <i>improved</i> from "C" to "B"
or "A", while 60 did not improve. If defects <i>are</i> such a handicap in
school, then what would be the chances of success in life outside.</p>

<p>In conclusion: this department of school hygiene deserves the earnest
aid of every young citizen, girl or boy. If each of us would honestly help
by maintaining quarantine in the case of contagious disease, by observing
the rules of the health department in fumigation, by acting upon advice
given in case of eyestrain, bad teeth, or adenoids, and most of all by
observing the rules of personal hygiene as laid down in this book, the city
in which we live would, a generation hence, contain stronger, more
prosperous, and more efficient citizens than it does to-day.</p>

<h3 class="p4">XXV. SOME GREAT NAMES IN BIOLOGY</h3>

<p class="p2">If we were to attempt to group the names associated with the
study of biology, we would find that in a general way they were connected
either with discoveries of a purely scientific nature or with the
benefiting of man's condition by the <i>application</i> of the purely
scientific discoveries. The first group are necessary in a science in order
that the second group may apply their work. It was necessary for men like
Charles Darwin or Gregor Mendel to prove their theories before men like
Luther Burbank or any of the men now working in the Department of
Agriculture could benefit mankind by growing new varieties of plants. The
discovery of scientific truths must be achieved before the men of modern
medicine can apply these great truths to the cure or prevention of disease.
Since we are most interested in discoveries which touch directly upon human
life, the men of whom this chapter treats will be those who, directly or
indirectly, have benefited mankind.</p>

<p><b>The Discoverers of Living Matter.</b>&mdash;The names of a number of
men living at different periods are associated with our first knowledge of
cells. About the middle of the seventeenth century microscopes came into
use. Through their use plant cells were first described and pictured as
hollow boxes or "cells." But it was not until 1838 that two German friends,
Schleiden and Schwann by name, working on plants and animals, discovered
that both of these forms of life contained a jellylike substance that later
came to be called <i>protoplasm</i>. Another German named Max Schultz in
1861 gave the name protoplasm to <i>all living matter</i>, and a little
later still Professor Huxley, a famous Englishman, friend and champion of
Charles Darwin, called attention to the physical and chemical qualities of
protoplasm so that it came to be known as the chemical and physical basis
of life.<a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

 <p class="captionj">Prof. Tyndall's experiment to show that if air
 containing germs is kept from organic substances, such substances will not
 decay. The box is sterilized; likewise the tubes (<i>t</i>) containing
 nutrients. Air is allowed to enter by the tubes (<i>u</i>), which are so
 made that dust is prevented from entering. A thermometer (<i>th</i>)
 records the temperature. The substances in the tubes do not decay, no
 matter how favorable the temperature.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Life comes from Life.</b>&mdash;Another group of men, after years of
patient experimentation, worked out the fact that <i>life comes from other
life</i>. In ancient times it was thought that life arose
<i>spontaneously</i>; for example, that fish or frogs arose out of the mud
of the river bottoms, and that insects came from the dew or rotting meat.
It was believed that bacteria arose spontaneously in water, even as late as
1876, when Professor Tyndall proved by experiment the contrary to be
true.</p>

<p>As early as 1651 William Harvey, the court physician of Charles I of
England, showed that all life came from the egg. It was much later,
however, that the part played by the sperm and egg cell in fertilization
was carefully worked out. It is to Harvey, too, that we owe the beginnings
of our knowledge of the circulation of the blood. He showed that blood
moved through tubes in the body and that the heart pumped it. He might be
called the father of modern physiology as well as the father of embryology.
A long list of names might be added to that of Harvey to show how gradually
our knowledge of the working of the human body has been added to. At the
present time we are far from knowing all the functions of the various parts
of the human engine, as is shown by the number of investigators in
physiology at the present time. Present-day problems have much to do with
the care of the human mechanism and with its surroundings. The solution of
these problems will come from applying the sciences of hygiene, preventive
medicine, and sanitation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
400]</span>In the preceding chapters of this book we have learned something
about our bodies and their care. We have found that man is able within
limitations to control his environment so as to make it better to live in.
All of the scientific facts that have been of use to man in the control of
disease have been found out by men who have devoted their lives in the hope
that their experiments and their sacrifices of time, energy, and sometimes
life itself might make for the betterment of the human race. Such men were
Harvey, Jenner, Lister, Koch, and Pasteur.</p>

 <p class="caption">Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Edward Jenner and Vaccination.</b>&mdash;The civilized world owes
much to Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination against smallpox. Born
in Berkeley, a little town of Gloucestershire, England, in 1749, as a boy
he showed a strong liking for natural history. He studied medicine and also
gave much time to the working out of biological problems. As early as 1775
he began to associate the disease called cowpox with that of smallpox, and
gradually the idea of inoculation against this terrible scourge, which
killed or disfigured hundreds of thousands every year in England alone, was
worked out and applied. He believed that if the two diseases were similar,
a person inoculated with the mild disease (cowpox) would after a slight
attack of this disease be immune against the more deadly and loathsome
smallpox. It was not until 1796 that he was able to prove his theory, as at
first few people would submit to vaccination. War at this time was being
waged between France and England, so that the former country, usually so
quick to appreciate the value of scientific discoveries, was slow to give
this method a trial. In spite of much opposition, however, <a
name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 401]</span>by
the year 1802, vaccination was practiced in most of the civilized countries
of the world. At the present time the death rate in Great Britain, the home
of vaccination, is less than .3 to every 1,000,000 living persons. This
shows that the disease is practically wiped out in England. An interesting
comparison with these figures might be made from the history of the disease
in parts of Russia where vaccination is not practiced. There, thousands of
deaths from smallpox occur annually. During the winter of 1913-1914 an
epidemic of smallpox with more than 250 cases broke out in the city of
Niagara Falls. This epidemic appears to be due to a campaign conducted by
people who do not believe in vaccination. In cities and towns near by,
where vaccination was practiced, no cases of smallpox occurred. Naturally
if opposition to vaccination is found nowadays, Jenner had a much harder
battle to fight in his day. He also had many failures, due to the imperfect
methods of his time. The full worth of his discovery was not fully
appreciated until long after his death, which occurred in 1823.</p>

 <p class="caption">Louis Pasteur.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Louis Pasteur.</b>&mdash;The one man who, in biological science, did
more than any other to directly benefit mankind was Louis Pasteur. Born in
1822, in the mountains near the border of northeastern France, he spent the
early part of his life as a normal boy, fond of fishing and not very
partial to study. He inherited from his father, however, a fine character
and grim determination, so that when he became interested in scientific
pursuits he settled down to work with enthusiasm and energy.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-five he became well known throughout France as a
physicist. Shortly after this he became interested in the tiny plants we
call bacteria, and it was in the field of bacteriology that he became most
<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
402]</span>famous. First as professor at Strassburg and at Lille, later as
director of scientific studies in the École Normale at Paris, he showed his
interest in the application of his discoveries to human welfare.</p>

<p>In 1857 Pasteur showed that fermentation was due to the presence of
bacteria, it having been thought up to this time that it was a purely
chemical process. This discovery led to very practical ends, for France was
a great wine-producing country, and with a knowledge of the cause of
fermentation many of the diseases which spoiled wine were checked.</p>

<p>In 1865-1868 Pasteur turned his attention to a silkworm disease which
threatened to wipe out the silk industry of France and Italy. He found that
this disease was caused by bacteria. After a careful study of the case he
made certain recommendations which, when carried out, resulted in the
complete overthrow of the disease and the saving of millions of dollars to
the poor people of France and Italy.</p>

<p>The greatest service to mankind came later in his life when he applied
certain of his discoveries to the treatment of disease. First experimenting
upon chickens and later with cattle, he proved that by making a virus
(poison) from the germs which caused certain diseases he could reduce this
virus to any desired strength. He then inoculated the animals with the
virus of reduced strength, giving the inoculated animals a mild attack of
the disease, and found that this made them <i>immune</i> from future
attacks. This discovery, first applied to chicken cholera, laid the
foundation for all future work in the uses of serums, vaccines, and
antitoxins.</p>

<p>Pasteur was perhaps the best known through his study of rabies. The
great Pasteur Institute, founded by popular subscriptions from all over the
world, has successfully treated over 22,000 cases of rabies with a death
rate of less than 1 per cent. But more than that it has been the place
where Roux, a fellow worker with Pasteur, discovered the antitoxin for
diphtheria which has resulted in the saving of thousands of human lives.
Here also have been established the principles of inoculation against
bubonic plague, lockjaw, and other germ diseases.</p>

<p>Pasteur died in 1895 at the age of seventy-three, "the most <a
name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg
403]</span>perfect man in the realm of science," a man beloved by his
countrymen and honored by the entire world.</p>

 <p class="caption">Robert Koch.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Robert Koch.</b>&mdash;Another name associated with the battle
against disease germs is that of Robert Koch. Born in Klausthal, Hanover,
in 1843, he later became a practicing physician, and about 1880 was called
to Berlin to become a member of the sanitary commission and professor in
the school of medicine. In 1881 he discovered the germ that causes
tuberculosis and two years later the germ that causes Asiatic cholera. His
later work has been directed toward the discovery of a cure for
tuberculosis and other germ diseases. As yet, however, no certain cure
seems to have been found.</p>

<p><b>Lister and Antiseptic Treatment of Wounds.</b>&mdash;A third great
benefactor of mankind was Sir Joseph Lister, an Englishman who was born in
1827. As a professor of surgery he first applied antiseptics in the
operating room. By means of the use of carbolic acid or other antiseptics
on the surface of wounds, on instruments, and on the hands and clothing of
the operating surgeons, disease germs were prevented from taking a foothold
in the wounds. Thus blood poisoning was prevented. This single discovery
has done more to prevent death after operations than any other of recent
time.</p>

<p><b>Modern Workers on the Blood.</b>&mdash;At the present time several
names stand out among investigators on the blood. Paul Ehrlich, a German
born in 1854, is justly famous for his work on the blood and its relation
to immunity from certain diseases. His last <a name="Page_404"
id="Page_404"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</span>great research has
given to the world a specific against the dread disease syphilis.</p>

<p>Another name associated with the blood is that of Elias Metchnikoff, a
Russian. He was born in 1845. Metchnikoff first advanced the belief that
the colorless blood corpuscles, or <i>phagocytes</i>, did service as the
sanitary police of the body. He has found that there are several different
kinds of colorless corpuscles, each having somewhat different work to do.
Much of the modern work done by physiologists on the blood are directly
founded on the discoveries of Metchnikoff.</p>

 <p class="caption">Charles Darwin, the grand old man of biology.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Heredity and Evolution. Charles Darwin.</b>&mdash;There is still
another important line of investigation in biology that we have not
mentioned. This is the doctrine of evolution and the allied discoveries
along the line of heredity. The development or evolution of plants and
animals from simpler forms to the many and present complex forms of life
have a practical bearing on the betterment of plants and animals, including
man himself. The one name indelibly associated with the word evolution is
that of Charles Darwin.</p>

<p>Charles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, a son of well-to-do
parents, in the pretty English village of Shrewsbury. As a boy he was very
fond of out-of-door life, was a collector of birds' eggs, stamps, coins,
shells, and minerals. He was an ardent fisherman, and as a young man became
an expert shot. His studies, those of the English classical school, were
not altogether to his liking. It is not strange, perhaps, that he was
thought a very ordinary boy, because his interest in the out-of-doors led
him to neglect his studies. Later he <a name="Page_405"
id="Page_405"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 405]</span>was sent to
Edinburgh University to study medicine. Here the dull lectures, coupled
with his intense dislike for operations, made him determine never to become
a physician. But all this time he showed his intense interest in natural
history and took frequent part in the discussions at the meetings of one of
the student zoölogical societies.</p>

<p>In 1828 his father sent him to Cambridge to study for the ministry. His
three years at the university were wasted so far as preparation for the
ministry were concerned, but they were invaluable in shaping his future. He
made the acquaintance of one or two professors who were naturalists like
himself, and in their company he spent many happy hours in roaming over the
countryside collecting beetles and other insects. In 1831 an event occurred
which changed his career and made Darwin one of the world's greatest
naturalists. He received word through one of his professional friends that
the position of naturalist on her Majesty's ship <i>Beagle</i> was open for
a trip around the world. Darwin applied for the position, was accepted, and
shortly after started on an eventful five years' trip around the world. He
returned to England a famous naturalist and spent the remainder of his long
and busy life producing books which have done more than those of any other
writer to account in a satisfactory way for the changes of form and habits
of plants and animals on the earth. His theories established a foundation
upon which plant and animal breeders were able to work.</p>

<p>His wonderful discovery of the doctrine of evolution was due not only to
his information and experimental evidence, but also to an iron
determination and undaunted energy. In spite of almost constant illness
brought about by eyestrain, he accomplished more than most well men have
done. His life should mean to us not so much the association of his name
with the <i>Origin of Species</i> or <i>Plants and Animals under
Domestication</i>, two of his most famous books, but rather that of a
patient, courteous, and brave gentleman who struggled with true English
pluck against the odds of disease and the attacks of hostile critics. He
gave to the world the proofs of the theory on which we to-day base the
progress of the world. Darwin lived long enough to see <a name="Page_406"
id="Page_406"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 406]</span>many of his critics
turn about and come over to his beliefs. He died on the 19th of April,
1882, at seventy-four years of age.</p>

<p>Associated with Darwin's name we must place two other co-workers on
heredity and evolution, Alfred Russel Wallace, an Englishman who
independently and at about the same time reached many of the conclusions
that Darwin came to, and August Weissman, a German. The latter showed that
the protoplasm of the germ cells (eggs and sperms) is directly handed down
from generation to generation, they being different from the other body
cells from the very beginning. In 1883 a German named Boveri discovered
that the chromosomes of the egg and the sperm cell were at the time of
fertilization just half in number of the other cells (see page <a
href="#Page_252">252</a>) so that a <i>fertilized</i> egg was really a
<i>whole cell</i> made up of <i>two half cells</i>, one from each parent.
The chromosomes within the nucleus, we remember, are believed to be the
bearers of the hereditary qualities handed down from parent to child. This
discovery shows us some of the mechanics of heredity.</p>

<p><b>Applications to Plant and Animal Breeding.</b>&mdash;Turning to the
practical applications of the scientific work on the method of heredity,
the name of Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, stands out most prominently.
Mendel lived from 1822 until 1884. His work, of which we already have
learned something (see page <a href="#Page_258">258</a>), remained
undiscovered until a few years ago. The application of his methods to plant
and animal raising are of the utmost importance because the breeder is able
to separate the qualities he desires and breed for those qualities only.
Another name we have mentioned with reference to plant breeding is Hugo de
Vries, the Dutchman who recently showed that in some cases plants arise as
new species by sudden and great variations known as <i>mutations</i>. And
lastly, in our own California, Luther Burbank, by careful hybridizing, is
making lasting fame with his new and useful hybrid plants.</p>

proper food and preparation of food, by care in home life; by sanitary
conditions in neighborhood and in home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Review of Activities of Cell</span>. Irritability,
food taking, assimilation, oxidation, excretion, reproduction. Similarity
of functions of plant and animal cells. All cells perform these functions.
Some cells perform functions especially well, <i>e.g.</i> contracting

to them. A system of tubes carries blood which carries food and oxygen.
Food must be prepared to get into the blood. Digestive system: mouth,
teeth, stomach, intestines, glands, and digestive juices. Uses of above in
preparing food to pass into the blood. Absorption of food into the blood.
How oxygen gets to the cells. Nose, throat, windpipe, lungs; blood goes to
lungs and carries away oxygen. Excretion. Cells give up wastes to blood and
these wastes taken out of blood by kidneys and other glands and passed out
of body. Sweat, urine, carbon dioxide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Certain Kinds of Work performed by Certain Kinds of
Cells</span>. Advantage of this. Cells of movement. Muscles, tissues. Bones
as levers necessary for some movements. This especially true for legs and
arms. Skeleton also necessary for protection of internal organs and support
of body. Making of special things in the body, <i>e.g.</i> digestive juices
given to certain cells called gland cells. Working together or coördination
of different organs provided for by nervous system. This is composed of
cells which are highly irritable or sensitive. Collections of these nerve
cells give us the power of feeling or sensation and of thinking.</p>

do not move at least once every day. Dangers of constipation. Poisonous
materials may be absorbed, causing lack of inclination to work, headache.
Importance of regular habits of emptying the bowels. Each one must try to
get at the cause of constipation in his own case. <i>Causes of
constipation.</i> Lack of exercise, improper food, not drinking enough
water, lack of laxative food, as fruits; lack of sleep, lack of regular
habits. <i>Remedies.</i> Avoid use of drugs. Half hour before breakfast a
glass of hot water, exercise of abdominal muscles, laxative foods, form
habit of moving bowels after breakfast.</p>

Sach's nutrient solution can best be obtained from a druggist at the time
needed and in very small and accurately measured quantities.</p>

<p>The agar or gelatine cultures in Petri dishes may be obtained from the
local Board of Health or from any good druggist. These cultures are not
difficult to make, but take a number of hours' consecutive work, often
difficult for the average teacher to obtain. Full directions how to prepare
these cultures will be found in Hunter's <i>Laboratory Problems in Civic
Biology</i>.<a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg

<h3>Transcriber's Notes:</h3>

<p>Punctuation, use of hyphens, and accent marks were standardized. Obsolete
and alternative spellings were left unchanged. Spelling of
'param&oelig;cium' and 'param&oelig;cia' were left
unchanged.</p>

<p>Footnotes were moved to the end of the chapter in which the anchor
occurs. Footnote anchors <span class="smaller">[6]</span> and <span
class="smaller">[7]</span> refer to the same footnote text, as do footnote
anchors <span class="smaller">[37]</span> and <span
class="smaller">[38]</span>.</p>

<p>A jump table was added to the index for the convenience of users.</p>

<p>For consistency within the text, 'zoological' was changed to 'zoölogical'
and 'diarrhea' to 'diarrh&oelig;a.'</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
